What's happening to this browser? For some reason, everything is opening as, like, the stuff you're opening—I'm watching it—and somehow all the light and dark mode stuff is opening as light mode, whereas in my normal Google Chrome it's opening normally. So I'm not sure what's happening here.

It's highly unsatisfactory. You see, you have to take full-page screenshots and analyze the whole logic of every website from the references. Also study each and every file within this subfolder, and then verify that our implementation follows everything in there. Well, except for the content itself, but how the content is organized - every block, every section of the website has to fit to using our content, yes, but still. So not just only the buttons, the whole thing, the entire DNA, the entire styling, the entire presentation logic, blocks, the entire wireframing, everything. @[references]
