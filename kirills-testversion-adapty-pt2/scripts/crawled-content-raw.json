Why? Because:\\n\\n- Paywall messaging that connects with an American user may fall flat for one from Europe – think cultural nuances.\\n- Paywall messaging that works for a Baby Boomer might not resonate well with someone from Gen Alpha – because of generational divides.\\n- Paywall messaging that appeals to females may not convert men – ties back to gendered behavior.\\n\\nIn addition to such natural segmentation, users also identify themselves into specific segments with their behavior. For example, a user who cancels their subscription during the trial – and tells you they’re doing so because of the subscription fee – can be a cost-conscious customer (a segment in its own right).\\n\\nYou get the drift.\\n\\nSaid another way…\\n\\n## There’s no one single paywall that can speak to all your segments equally well\\n\\nYou need more paywalls – more so, personalized paywalls for all your significant user segments – that contain the drivers that get _them_ to convert.\\n\\nPaywall personalization is all about personalizing your paywall for all the different user segments your app caters to. Personalized paywalls are one of [the top ten mobile paywall types](https://adapty.io/blog/the-10-types-of-mobile-app-paywalls) that, when done right, help boost an app’s revenue significantly across all segments.\\n\\nIn today’s post, we’ll see several types of mobile app paywall personalizations, how mobile app paywall personalizations work, and how you can start offering personalized paywalls at scale inside your app.\\n\\n## Personalizing mobile app paywalls using zero-party data\\n\\nIn an effort to keep up with the ever-increasing net of privacy frameworks in the app ecosystem, many app businesses are adding systems to proactively collect zero-party data.\\n\\nBut what’s zero-party data exactly?\\n\\nZero-party data is any data users explicitly declare and share with a business. At Adapty, we see zero-party data as an excellent opportunity for mobile app businesses not just for extending hyper-personalized app experiences but also for designing personalized paywalls that convert better.\\n\\nForrester – the world’s leading market research company that also coined the term (“zero-party data”) and introduced it to the world – [defines it as](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/straight-from-the-source-collecting-zero-party-data-from-customers/): **_“Data that a customer intentionally and proactively shares with a brand, which can include preference center data, purchase intentions, personal context, and how the individual wants the brand to recognize it.”_**\\n\\nMobile app businesses are actively building zero-party databases.\\n\\nFor example, many apps now add a “ _sign up_” stage to their onboarding process. As a part of this signup comes the onboarding stage, where apps ask users for some data (like their gender or age when it’s relevant) and how they expect to use the apps:\\n\\n- If it’s a personal finance app, it’ll ask for a user’s key long-term financial goals.\\n- A fitness app, in contrast, might ask a user how much weight they’re looking to shed.\\n- Likewise, a mental health app might ask questions to evaluate the user’s current state of mind.\\n\\nAll these inputs are examples of zero-party data.\\n\\n_\\\\[Sidenote: Such data can also be classified as first-party data. But with the introduction of the zero-party data concept, such data becomes zero-party data. More on this later.\\\\]_\\n\\nThanks to this approach, apps learn a lot about their users right during the signup and onboarding stages. All the data an app acquires this way works really well for delivering personalized paywalls. Let’s now see how such data helps with paywall personalizations.\\n\\n### One-to-many mobile app paywall personalization\\n\\nIn this personalization type, you take the broadest segments in your target user base and show each a personalized version of your paywall. For instance, a general fitness app’s users can be broadly classified by gender into three segments: male, female, and non-binary.\\n\\nWithout personalization in place, an app would show each user (irrespective of their orientation) the exact same paywall.\\n\\nHowever, with personalization, each of the three segments can be shown a paywall that connects better with them. An excellent example of such personalization comes from the yoga app Daily Yoga. (By the way, Daily Yoga was [one of the top five most downloaded apps in 2021](https://www.data.ai/en/insights/market-data/health-and-fitness-app-downloads-surpass-pre-pandemic-levels/).)\\n\\nWhen you download Daily Yoga, the app asks you for a few inputs, including your gender.\\n\\n![635a34e4b83821ed7f54ff1c lxeh5c bkemgwgfdpz7c3f8 qnfx jyull0h4oo7n6nb ws01xxalowyfyv4aocpvwoh7txwhdbwwxvp bemcolutdbnzkqb4hxl6hkns5i](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/635a34e4b83821ed7f54ff1c_lxeh5c_bkemgwgfdpz7c3f8-qnfx_jyull0h4oo7n6nb-ws01xxalowyfyv4aocpvwoh7txwhdbwwxvp_bemcolutdbnzkqb4hxl6hkns5i-tjwb1zeqifpvogn4f6th34eubqlztook8b6egmmcavvcsjyorqsujaokx1lrlryfaay5ac7ocodv9_crsa.png)An app collecting zero-party data\\n\\nWhen the user identifies as a woman, they see a personalized paywall (specific to women). In contrast, users who identify as men are shown another version of the paywall (personalized for men):\\n\\n![635a34e4b83821fecc54ff27 oquhdy0y46j pez7jtknsvp7ul64x6hvyt8 jg4](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/635a34e4b83821fecc54ff27_oquhdy0y46j-pez7jtknsvp7ul64x6hvyt8-jg4-trvoiixsmfx17oneghno8aswedkk6cpzvpk5u0kpnchlvkzzqbalc8zbpdnu97lu9rnbweoezcoxifge2l_kpyrqpcmssl4u1qwxd8y2aqia7vjo6ldftfeqreqbjqc0nueidv4yjoqcue6ri8eega.png)\\n\\nIf you think about it, you might wonder when the user consented to have their data read and processed like this, even if only to personalize the onboarding process and paywall.\\n\\nWell, they did. The app’s signup page – which shows up when the user opens the app for the very first time – clearly adds the disclaimer saying that by ” _clicking the button you agree to our Terms of Services and Privacy Policy:_”\\n\\n![ezgif 3 cb1fb5b231](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ezgif-3-cb1fb5b231.webp)An app claiming implied consent for nonintrusive personalizations  across the app and paywall.\\n\\nLet’s return to the personalization aspect.\\n\\nNaturally, when the different segments see paywalls personalized for them, they can connect better with them. Imagine if a female user sees the male workout video on the paywall, the content won’t likely resonate so well with them as it won’t feel relevant.\\n\\nLet’s now look at another kind of paywall personalization.\\n\\n### One-to-few paywall personalization\\n\\nUnlike the one-to-many personalization type, one-to-few personalization talks to narrower user segments. For example, if an app’s key demographics speak four languages, the app can use four localized paywalls.\\n\\nIn Morning Routine: Wake Up Alarm (a lifestyle app), paywalls are customized based on the user’s language preference. Morning Routine: Wake Up Alarm uses its user’s preferred language to show them a personalized (translated) version of the app paywall (and the entire app).\\n\\nIf the user uses the app in English, they see the paywall in English, and when they set their app language to Portuguese, they see the Portuguese version:\\n\\n![635a34e45f1f0a5135ad2d08 xvhtmz35v9xvbn10m03jnsfyqumg2qkfwllvrcxqgw2kbxj vvphfxu4clk8uruqmaxxv nefsnybrlepja5gbodmvuf67jkta68heqwq](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/635a34e45f1f0a5135ad2d08_xvhtmz35v9xvbn10m03jnsfyqumg2qkfwllvrcxqgw2kbxj_vvphfxu4clk8uruqmaxxv-nefsnybrlepja5gbodmvuf67jkta68heqwq-s_ibxsjify4plguqqixojdpujnogid5pirotwwwpodhdpjnekq7enop7g8iup_a21ucnnz8whxnkxg3mocfa.png)\\n\\nBut that’s not all.\\n\\nApp paywalls can get even more personalized.\\n\\n### One-to-one mobile app paywall personalization\\n\\nIn contrast to one-to-many and one-to-few paywall personalizations, one-to-one paywall personalization gives the user the impression that the paywall is speaking exclusively to them and that it (the app) understands the user’s needs and motivations at a very personal level.\\n\\nYou could call this “hyper-personalization” in a way.\\n\\nOne of the best ways to implement one-to-one paywall personalization is to address the user by their name. Because when a paywall does that, it seems as if it’s designed exclusively for the app user.\\n\\nLifesum, the healthy living app, shines at such one-to-one personalization. How? During its signup and onboarding, Lifesum asks for the user’s name. And then, on the paywall, the app calls the user out by their name:\\n\\n![635a34e44b79fbf354d4b498 qku60efa3bubucmax4rnianwobu9ssxucrgzx3edtjtfpklr7gxauyh1l7qc7jw5gxwu2sno5xmixtjpc2eabp7mkrwhodaq9ccrkzliuu1rbtvk5gzt5yakvzvh6vog0 dlrdrfqdc9llpf5eemi1bn7](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/635a34e44b79fbf354d4b498_qku60efa3bubucmax4rnianwobu9ssxucrgzx3edtjtfpklr7gxauyh1l7qc7jw5gxwu2sno5xmixtjpc2eabp7mkrwhodaq9ccrkzliuu1rbtvk5gzt5yakvzvh6vog0_dlrdrfqdc9llpf5eemi1bn7-kadbmhakhporhtwkd3rpoiptn5dzh2moxizq.png)A personalized mobile app paywall using a name-based personalization.\\n\\nUsing such personalization instantly connects with the user and hints at how the app really personalizes their health journey, something they genuinely care about.\\n\\nThis app could also use the user’s target weight to further personalize the app paywall. It could say something like “ _<User name>, lose those <X> kgs & enter 2023 as a new you!”_ and it would make an even more compelling case to upgrade. Weight here would be another zero-party data (a custom attribute, to be specific) that you’d collect and tie to the user’s profile.\\n\\n## Personalizing mobile app paywalls using first-party data\\n\\nLet’s now talk about paywall personalization using first-party data. In contrast to zero-party data that’s declared and explicit, first-party data is any data that you collect via your property (app, in this case).\\n\\nFor example, if you use [Adapty’s SDK to power your app’s paywall and run experiments](https://adapty.io/blog/ab-testing-guide-part-3-how-to-run-ab-tests-on-paywalls), you can collect a lot of first-party data from your users.\\n\\nThis could be the data about their 1) device (attributes like their phone’s OS or app version, for instance), 2) how you acquired them, and 3) the state of their subscriptions or in-app purchases.\\n\\nWith Adapty, you don’t just get to collect this data, but you can also use it to segment your users and deliver personalized paywalls.\\n\\nFor instance, If you use Adapty’s attribution data, you can see which ad has driven a certain user to your app or even the app’s paywall. Using Adapty, you can further show this user a personalized paywall that matches the messaging or an offer that the user saw on the ad. This helps boost your conversion rate for your paid lead segment.\\n\\nYou can also use your users’ purchase history data to plan personalized paywalls.\\n\\nAdapty offers predefined segments for implementing personalized paywalls. For example, you can get Adapty to filter your _freemium users that have never subscribed_. While [there are many reasons app users go from freemium to premium](https://adapty.io/blog/top-reasons-mobile-app-users-go-from-freemium-to-premium), a good offer remains a top one. So one way to entice this user segment into paying is to show them a personalized offer on the paywall. (We even ship this as a pre-defined segment.)\\n\\nYou can use any data that Adapty collects to create your segments and deliver personalized paywalls. Adapty also makes it possible to personalize a paywall based on any custom attributes that you define. [Check out the Adapty’s custom attributes data for more on this.](https://adapty.io/docs/profiles-crm#custom-attributes)\\n\\nIf zero-party data lets you segment your users using their self-declared preferences, first-party data lets you segment your users based on their mobile app behavior. Both have their ways of being used. Using both zero- and first-party data, you can personalize almost all the elements that live on your paywall, including:\\n\\n- Header area (banners, sliders, or videos)\\n- Messaging\\n- Plans\\n\\nWe’ve discussed these in detail in our earlier post on [the essential elements of mobile app paywalls](https://adapty.io/blog/designing-effective-paywalls-for-mobile-apps), so make sure to check it out.\\n\\nSo that brings us to the real question: _How do you build a personalized paywall inside your mobile app?_\\n\\n## Three simple steps to creating a personalized paywall (using a solution like Adapty)\\n\\n### Step \\\\#1: Define your personalization strategy\\n\\nTo deliver meaningful personalized paywall experiences, you need to treat paywall personalization as an experiment. So don’t personalize your paywall elements randomly.\\n\\nLook at your data – the natural segments you cater to, their natural preferences, and how they behave in your app – and hypothesize personalizations that will create a positive impact and drive more conversions.\\n\\nIf you see you need more data, start collecting it. Even Google wants you to now [lean more on zero- and first-party data for “privacy-safe” growth](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of-marketing/digital-transformation/sustainable-first-party-data-strategy/).\\n\\n### Step \\\\#2: Create segments\\n\\nNext, create your segments using the attributes you just identified.\\n\\nWith [a paywall and experimentation solution like Adapty](https://adapty.io/), you can choose any attribute you collect (via Adapty or through custom attributes) to [create highly targeted segments](https://adapty.io/docs/segments). For example, below, you’ve a segment that’s filtering U.S users who unsubscribed during their trial. As you can see, to find such users, you need to look at two attributes:\\n\\n1. The user’s location (using their IP address)\\n2. And their subscriptions state\\n\\n![6336c10b40a446f9773b6989 hwzb2rwauxz8mrp7vqntkdp7cnjdpvr01](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c10b40a446f9773b6989_hwzb2rwauxz8mrp7vqntkdp7cnjdpvr01-hasbolajngbn2hyu4oveh8zhsqywiqqbgjenkuq1ddp0ivmdf6sdgfrlqcrivepm8zrdcdhhehzwn1l036ebodmaxnmii9opf7a_fupmtikpy5m8taf8vtjpk_c8dl_bxp63z_ultjuangqxbinxbm3a.png)\\n\\n[There are endless ways you can use attributes (those that Adapty identifies by default and the custom ones you set)](https://adapty.io/docs/segments) to create segments to target for personalizations. Just use a descriptive name for your cohort/segment so you can use it easily in the next step. In this example, we’re calling our segment “ _U.S unsubscribed during trial._”\\n\\n### Step \\\\#3: Test!\\n\\nIf a user skips your onboarding and doesn’t provide you with any data, what paywall do they see? They see your app’s default (non-personalized) paywall. All mobile apps have a “default” paywall. This default paywall is, by default, live for all users.\\n\\nBut since you want to show personalized paywalls, you need to add your personalized paywall(s) to your app’s build. [Doing so is very easy with Adapty.](https://adapty.io/paywalls-ab-testing)\\n\\nNext, you need to choose the segments that should see your personalized paywalls. To do so, you need to [set a few targeting rules.](https://adapty.io/docs/ab-tests) Below, you have a personalized paywall targeting the segment of users who canceled their subscription: (If you do a personalized paywall for such users and give them an irresistible upgrade offer, you’ll likely win back a good percentage of them.)\\n\\n![635a34e4fd6f24dbef7f8268 nicyzr6 cuvmxf59dljjovbo bvnsh5pmuzk kutrs vlolauyahu79q7hxhz3jugdvlwdr806w3p0qtfp0sey5f9gvyelprulwkukjbzqtlrc4xl4v5l0lbszvqjcsbpag7r7cszc2y5imcctoyt9vxarriucnmypk](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/635a34e4fd6f24dbef7f8268_nicyzr6-cuvmxf59dljjovbo-bvnsh5pmuzk_kutrs-vlolauyahu79q7hxhz3jugdvlwdr806w3p0qtfp0sey5f9gvyelprulwkukjbzqtlrc4xl4v5l0lbszvqjcsbpag7r7cszc2y5imcctoyt9vxarriucnmypk-bmduxp8op0nwjnl8whwjrnpqxg.png)\\n\\nWith Adapty, all the segments that you create (see the above step for reference) can be used for targeting. Just choose the target segment and launch your test!\\n\\n## Wait… but users don’t want to share their data, right? And personalizations need data.\\n\\nIn an Accenture [study](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-77/accenture-pulse-survey.pdf), 83% of consumers stated that they’d be willing to share their data for getting personalized experiences “ _as long as businesses are transparent about how they are going to use it and that customers have control over it._”\\n\\nIn another McKinsey [research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying), 72% of the respondents said that they expected “ _the businesses they buy from to recognize them as individuals and know their interests._” When McKinsey asked consumers to define personalization, consumers associated “ _it with positive experiences of being made to feel special._”\\n\\nThese are in line with Gartner’s [findings](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/how-to-straddle-personalization-and-privacy). Gartner states that _“71% of B2C and 86% of B2B customers expect companies to be well informed about their personal information during an interaction.”_\\n\\nClearly, personalization is an “expectation,” and users are open to exchanging data for it. The only thing you need to do is understand how you can balance privacy and personalization across your app. Users seem to happily share data for personalized experiences when they trust a business and understand what data they’re sharing, how it’s being used, and if and how they can revoke access.\\n\\n## Wrapping it up…\\n\\nPersonalized paywalls can help you connect with your users on a personal “one-to-one” level. The results? More in-app purchases and subscriptions.\\n\\nBut don’t take our word for it.\\n\\nTest!\\n\\nRun an experiment and show half of your users a generic paywall and the other half a personalized version. Find out for yourself the one that resonates better with your users.\\n\\nIf you’re looking for a solution to deliver personalized paywalls inside your mobile app, [check out Adapty.](https://adapty.io/) With Adapty, you can offer personalized paywalls at scale in just three easy steps.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

She’s been working in mobile for over a decade, building flows that convert and retain. This article is based on the talk she gave during the Adapty Сonf in Warsaw. You can_ [_watch the recording_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYFmKH30YE8) _on Adapty’s YouTube._\\n\\nI’ve been working in mobile for more than a decade now, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: most companies don’t have a retention problem. They have an activation problem.\\n\\nLet me explain.\\n\\n## **Why 77% of users never come back after three days**\\n\\nHere’s a stat that should make every product person uncomfortable: **77% of people will never come back to your product after three days of downloading your app.**\\n\\n![Retention Gragh](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Retention-gragh.webp)\\n\\nThree days. 72 hours. That’s all the time you get before users have decided they never want to see you again.\\n\\nWe spend months building features, perfecting our product, and iterating on functionality. And then people download it, take one look, and ghost us forever.\\n\\nThis tells me something important: when companies come to me saying, “We have a retention problem,” I usually find they’re looking in the wrong place. You can’t retain someone who was never activated in the first place. The product was never sticking because it never got stuck to begin with.\\n\\n## **How good onboarding impacts your bottom line**\\n\\nHere’s the beautiful cycle of [onboarding optimization](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/): the better your onboarding flow performs, the more efficiently you’re operating. The more efficient you are, the more time you have to spend talking to customers. The more you talk to customers, the better your flows become. Better flows mean better activation. Better activation means better retention.\\n\\nAnd better retention? That means more money.\\n\\nI’m not being vague here. [A good onboarding flow](https://adapty.io/blog/why-users-delete-your-app-in-24-hours/) can have an impact of more **than 50% on your retention**.\\n\\nAt one company I worked with, we focused exclusively on onboarding optimization. First experiment, second experiment, 25th experiment, 27th experiment. By the time we hit experiment 27, things really took off. These minor tweaks added up to a **59% increase in MRR** — not by changing our advertising or optimizing the app store listing, just by tweaking the onboarding: same traffic volume, massively different outcomes.\\n\\n![Onboarding Optimization Results](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/onboarding-optimization-results.webp)\\n\\n## **Why you should think of onboarding like a blind date**\\n\\nWhen I think about onboarding flows, I think about blind dates.\\n\\nYou know how blind dates work, right? You get a little bio, maybe a name, sometimes not even that. You show up knowing almost nothing about this person. That’s exactly how your users feel when they download your app.\\n\\nSo I asked ChatGPT what makes a good first date. Here’s what our AI friend told me:\\n\\n- **Clear communication** – Are we doing that in our onboarding?\\n- **Learn about each other** – We have to understand who this person is\\n- **Tailor the experience** – Customize based on their interests and preferences\\n- **Create reliability** – Be honest, transparent, and respectful\\n\\nThat last one is crucial. Building trust is the entire goal of your onboarding.\\n\\nWe have to remember the context here. A lot of people download apps while they’re on the toilet, scrolling between meetings. They see an ad, they download, they forget to open it. There’s a **20% drop-off between download and first app open**. When people finally come back to your app days later, they might not even remember what it is from just a little logo on their screen.\\n\\nThis is why we need to focus on reducing anxiety and boosting product engagement from the very first moment.\\n\\n## **Stop being so pushy with permissions**\\n\\nI need to talk about permissions because I see so many apps getting this wrong.\\n\\nI downloaded one app recently, and here’s what happened: I opened it and immediately got hit with ATT (App Tracking Transparency). Before I could even respond to that, I needed location permission. On top of that, push notifications. Stack, stack, stack. All system pop-ups.\\n\\nIt was overwhelming.\\n\\nObviously, sometimes your app needs permissions to function. But let’s ask for them in a nice way. **Stop being so pushy so early. Don’t ask for so much so soon.**\\n\\n### **The ATT exception: Put it first**\\n\\nATT is three years old now, and I still have apps coming to me saying, “We’re not getting our opt-ins.”\\n\\nMy first response? Put it right at the beginning.\\n\\nI know this goes against everything I just said about permissions, but ATT is different. Here are two messages I literally received in the last couple of weeks from different companies:\\n\\n“Btw, I was going to mention to you that we took your advice of moving the ATT prompt to the first app open moment, and were able to more than double our opt-in rate from about 6% to 15%. That probably won’t surprise you, but I figured the least we could do was give you another data point. Thanks for the tip!”\\n\\n“Onboarding and trial starts were the same on both treatments. However, showing the ATT prompt right at the start increased the acceptance rate from 8% to 13%.”\\n\\nBy putting ATT at the very beginning, without even a pretty custom request screen, you won’t have any negative impact on conversion, engagement, or retention. But you will basically **double your opt-in rate**. There’s no downside here. Just think of it like a cookie banner and get it over with.\\n\\nEvery other permission? Be polite. ATT? Just do it.\\n\\n## **The 5 principles of onboarding flows that convert**\\n\\nWhenever you’re building or [optimizing an onboarding flow](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-fix-your-onboarding-flow/), make sure it’s anxiety-busting. This means it has to be:\\n\\n1. **Simple**\\n2. **Educational**\\n3. **Personalized**\\n4. **Trust-building**\\n5. **Engaging**\\n\\nAnd you need to do all of that while also **tracking everything and optimizing continuously.**\\n\\nLet me break these down with real examples.\\n\\n### **1.** **Make it simple: 87% leave because it wasn’t clear**\\n\\nHere’s a stat that should scare you: **87% of people have left an onboarding flow because it wasn’t clear to them.**\\n\\n[Photoroom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photoroom-ai-photo-editor/id1455009060) is a perfect example of doing this right. They have this amazing functionality that automatically cuts you out of a photo and puts you on a transparent background. During onboarding, they actually demonstrate this feature with your own image. They guide you through the main reason people download the app. It’s straightforward, it’s simple, and you immediately understand the value.\\n\\n### **2.** **Educate people on why you’re asking**\\n\\nTeach potential subscribers about your product’s values and benefits. Communicate clearly why you’re asking for things.\\n\\n[Hily](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hily-dating-app-meet-date/id1250946975) has a great example of this. When they ask about notifications, they don’t just show a system prompt. They ask: “What notifications would you like to receive? Only important ones or all notifications.”\\n\\nI’m sorry, Hily, but copy this. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel here.\\n\\n### **3.** **Personalize for everyone (yes, really)**\\n\\n[Nebula](https://apps.apple.com/lk/app/nebula-horoscope-astrology/id1459969523) does personalization fantastically. I went through their onboarding and selected “be prepared for the future” as my goal. The way they formatted the entire experience around that choice was impressive. I actually went back and tried different options to see how they personalized each path.\\n\\nThis reminds me of a story. I was working at a subscription app a few years ago where the founder thought it was totally fine to ask for an email address and phone number, but thought asking for someone’s name was “too personal.”\\n\\nI started running secret experiments with the developers (yes, I was literally conspiring with my devs). We added a name field to the onboarding. We didn’t even use it. We didn’t database it. We just wanted to see what would happen.\\n\\nAnd what we saw was a **13% uplift in activation****,** just by asking for the name. We had higher conversion and higher retention from perceived personalization. We were just being friendly.\\n\\nEventually, because of these stats, the founder decided that yes, he would make more money by being friendly. So we rolled it out to everyone.\\n\\n### **4.** **Build trust constantly**\\n\\nSocial proof. Testimonials. Progress bars. Accolades. Trust, trust, trust, trust, trust.\\n\\n[Zing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zing-ai-home-gym-workouts/id1552207792) is absolutely smashing this. As you scroll, their onboarding shows “Trusted by 600,000 people” with testimonials, quotes, and accolades. It’s social proofing 101, and they’re executing it perfectly.\\n\\n### **5.** **Create positive friction (yes, friction can be good**\\n\\nDownload an app called [Spark](https://apps.apple.com/tn/app/spark-gratitude-journal/id6449037222). It’s a gratitude app, and they do something brilliant in their onboarding.\\n\\nBefore you even create an account, they ask you to write something you’re grateful for. Then you have to hold down a button. As you hold it, you get haptic feedback. Stars explode. It tells you “well done.”\\n\\nThis pause — this moment of positive friction — is perfect for a meditative app. You have to stop, break, and think about what you’re grateful for. It’s not a typical “sign up and give us your money” flow. It’s building a relationship immediately. It’s making you feel something.\\n\\nThat’s engagement.\\n\\n## **Why tracking isn’t optional**\\n\\nI worked at a company once where the CTO genuinely believed it wasn’t important to track things. He thought we only needed to track first app open, complete sign-up, trial start, and conversion. That’s it.\\n\\nI had to beg to track the individual button that literally closes. “Please, can we track the closing of this button?” I had to go around talking to developers, founders, content people, explaining why we need to understand where drop-offs happen.\\n\\nHere’s the thing: how else will you know you’ve achieved a 2.5x increase in conversions unless you’re tracking it?\\n\\nI recently started working with an app that’s grown entirely organically to millions in revenue through YouTube alone. They’ve never done any marketing. And they’ve never tracked anything. Now they want to optimize their flows, and they have no historical data. Nothing. It’s all been through the App Store.\\n\\n### **Three simple steps to start tracking**\\n\\n**1\\\\. Choose your tool**\\n\\nPick your analytics platform. There are many, but Mixpanel or Amplitude are two of the simpler, more accessible, and more intuitive options to get started with. Adapty also integrates with both of these platforms: [Mixpanel](https://adapty.io/integrations/mixpanel/) and [Amplitude](https://adapty.io/integrations/amplitude/).\\n\\n**2\\\\. Build a tracking map**\\n\\nCreate a literal document showing what you want to track, the event properties, the reasons you need them, and the triggers. Just conveying that you have a plan will get you a long way with your developers.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Ask your developer nicely**\\n\\nShout-out to all the developers who handle our constant requests. They’ll help you if you ask nicely. Tracking is vital.\\n\\n## **The power of continuous experimentation**\\n\\nRemember that 59% MRR increase I mentioned? That took 27 experiments. You don’t stop after one experiment shows a 2% uplift. You keep going. You drive more value.\\n\\nAt one company, we changed the copy on the paywall button. That’s it—just the button text.\\n\\nWhen it said **“Subscribe”**, we had a 3% registration-to-trial rate.\\n\\nWhen it said **“Start your 7-day free trial”**, we had a **27% registration-to-trial rate**.\\n\\nTest and learn. Feel like a detective uncovering clues. Every single thing you do should have a purpose. What am I learning from this? How am I scaling this?\\n\\n## **Does onboarding length actually matter?**\\n\\nIt’s not about length, it’s about how you use it.\\n\\nA founder of a kids app (well, a parent app for kids) told me: “We actually tested a competitor’s really long, engaging onboarding flow. Our short onboarding seems to be outperforming in terms of install-to-paid.”\\n\\nSometimes long-winded onboarding gets that initial conversion because you’ve tricked someone into it. They’ve gone through all these steps and then “Oh, pay $1 to see the answers.” But you might have tricked them into that conversion.\\n\\nSometimes being upfront, communicative, and honest, and building trust in a short, concise way, leads to better install-to-paid conversion. Shorter onboarding flows can be just as effective.\\n\\n## **Key takeaways: What you need to remember**\\n\\nLet me leave you with the essentials:\\n\\n- **Shorter onboarding flows can also be effective** – Don’t assume longer is always better\\n- **Optimizing onboarding directly impacts retention** – This isn’t just a nice-to-have, it’s revenue\\n- **Use custom screens before system dialogues** (except with ATT) – Build context before asking\\n- **Always ask for ATT on first launch** – Unless you’re spending Duolingo-level money, just put it first\\n- **Experiment and iterate continuously** – That 27th experiment might be your breakthrough\\n- **Track everything** – You can’t optimize what you don’t measure\\n\\nThe best thing you can do right now? Delete your app. Download it again. Go through your own onboarding flow. See how you feel.\\n\\nThat’s where real insight starts.\\n\\n[![Onboarding Blbanner 1](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Onboarding_blog-banner-1-1024x286.webp)](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/?utm_campaign=29683057-GTM%20%7C%20Onboarding%20Builder&utm_source=blog&utm_content=how-to-build-onboarding-flows)\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### My onboarding has like 8 screens. Is that too many?\\n\\nDepends. Are those 8 screens doing something useful, or are you just stalling before the paywall? Hannah’s point was that length doesn’t matter—value does. If you’re using those screens to explain your product, personalize the experience, and build trust, that’s fine. If you’re just showing a bunch of “swipe to see feature #4” slides that nobody reads, yeah, cut that.\\n\\n### I put ATT at the end because I didn’t want to scare people away immediately. That’s wrong?\\n\\nYeah, flip it. I know it feels aggressive, but multiple apps reported doubling their ATT opt-in rate by putting it first—no custom screen, no explanation, just the system prompt. And it didn’t hurt their conversions at all. Users expect it now. Hiding it at the end doesn’t make them more likely to accept it.\\n\\n### How do I know which screen is making people leave?\\n\\nYou have to track it. Add events for every screen: viewed onboarding step 1, viewed step 2, etc. Then look at your funnel in Mixpanel or Amplitude or whatever. You’ll see exactly where the drop-off happens. Can’t fix what you can’t see.\\n\\n### What if I don’t know what to A/B test?\\n\\nStart with copy. It’s the easiest thing to change and often has big impact. That example where changing “Subscribe” to “Start your 7-day free trial” took conversion from 3% to 27%? That’s just button text. You don’t need to redesign your whole flow—just test whether your messaging is clear.\\n\\n### Do I really need to ask users questions during onboarding? Feels like extra friction.\\n\\nSometimes friction is good. If asking “What’s your fitness goal?” lets you personalize what they see next, that’s worth it. One app added a name field and got a 13% bump in conversions just because it felt more personal. But yeah, don’t ask questions just to ask questions. Make it useful.\\n\\n### Our refund rate is like 40%. Is that fixable with onboarding?\\n\\nProbably, yeah. High refunds usually mean people subscribed without understanding what they were getting. If your onboarding doesn’t clearly show the value, some users will pay just to see what happens, then immediately refund. Better onboarding = fewer confused subscribers = fewer refunds.\\n\\n### I’m a solo dev, is all this testing and tracking realistic for me?\\n\\nYou don’t need a data team, but you do need basic tracking. Set up Mixpanel or Amplitude (they have free tiers), track your key events, and run simple A/B tests one at a time. It’s more realistic than you think. The hard part is just starting.\\n\\n### Honestly, is onboarding optimization even worth it compared to just getting more users?\\n\\nIf 77% of your users are leaving in three days, getting more users just means more people churning. Fixing activation first means every new user you acquire is actually worth something. Otherwise you’re pouring water into a leaky bucket.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses give you insights that can help you:\\n\\n1. Set realistic goals for your mobile app.\\n2. Plan sales and marketing strategies.\\n3. Adjust them as needed for sustainable growth.\\n\\nSo let’s understand TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses, how they apply to mobile apps, and how to calculate them!\\n\\nHere goes.\\n\\n## What is TAM?\\n\\nTAM – Total Addressable Market or Total Available Market – represents the market or “opportunity” available for your mobile app. For example, if you’re looking to launch a meditation mobile app, then your target market comprises people going through all kinds of conditions like stress, anxiety, and depression. You’re also looking at people looking for better mental health or mood. Finally, you’ll also cater to users specifically seeking help with mindfulness therapies like meditation.\\n\\nAs you can see, you zoom out when you look at TAM. For example, the revenue potential for a meditation mobile app, if it captures the whole TAM, would be 7.25 billion U.S. dollars by 2033, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1390630/meditation-app-market-forecast/). Because that’s how big the market for meditation apps is projected to get.\\n\\nOn a side note, when you want to perform TAM analysis, tapping resources like Statista and industry publications can help a lot. They offer the latest data and projections, which is enough at the TAM stage.\\n\\nBack to TAM… So, as you can see, you aren’t very concerned about any granular details when working with TAM. In general, TAM tells you three things:\\n\\n- **TAM tells you your app’s overall opportunity.** When planning a new app, you want to be sure there’s a market for it. TAM tells you just that. When performing TAM analysis, it’s important to remember that TAM doesn’t use any filters, so the market size it suggests isn’t your actual market. SAM helps define the actual market, as we’ll see in the next section.\\n- **TAM, by itself, is too broad.** Because TAM looks at the market theoretically, it’s crucial to consider SAM along with it, which provides a more realistic view of your app’s potential market .\\n- **TAM tells you how your target market could look if your app evolved into a more mature solution.** Adding PAM – Potentially Addressable Market – analysis on top of your TAM analysis can give ideas as to how your app could have a bigger target market than you initially estimated. For example, if, at some point, this meditation app from our example expanded to include online therapy, then this app could target even more users.\\n\\n## What is SAM?\\n\\nSAM – Serviceable Addressable Market or Serviceable Available Market – represents the market that you can actually target. To arrive at SAM, you apply filters to your TAM analysis and eliminate user populations that TAM included in your addressable market, but that don’t really belong to it.\\n\\nLet’s return to our meditation app example. Here are a few considerations we’d use for deducing the actual Service Addressable Market from its Total Addressable Market:\\n\\n- Suppose this app is to be available only in the U.S. This means the app’s TAM shrinks to represent the market available in the U.S. alone.\\n- Since this app only offers meditation, filtering at the feature level makes sense. For example, SAM would be the subset of the total U.S. population actively seeking or using a meditation app. So you might want to consider 12% of the total U.S. population to be your SAM, [as this population uses a mobile app to help with meditation.](https://www.statista.com/topics/11045/meditation-and-mental-wellness-apps/#editorsPicks) (Note: Again, resources like Statista help with SAM analysis.)\\n- Next, let’s say this is an iPhone app. This further excludes Android users from the growth calculations.\\n\\nYou get the drift.\\n\\nYour SAM is always a small percentage of your TAM. And in one way, your SAM is actually your TAM, because, in reality, it is the one that truly represents the available market. Also, while there’s no industry standard, some resources claim SAM to be generally about 1-10% of TAM.\\n\\n- **Depending on your app, you can have a small or big SAM, but a small SAM isn’t necessarily a problem.** A niche app will naturally have a much smaller SAM than apps targeting broader populations.\\n- **SAM helps you frame your monetization model.** If you have a niche app, you’re looking at a significantly small addressable user population or SAM. This means even if you reach a respectable user base, you’ll still not be looking at hundreds of thousands of users. If you use a strictly subscription-based monetization model for such an app, then you may limit your revenue potential. A hybrid monetization model could offer a better average revenue per user… and increase revenue.\\n- **SAM evolves as your app evolves.** As you start offering your app through additional channels (for example, adding your app to the Play Store, too, after initially only launching it in the App Store), regions, or languages, your SAM expands. Not just that, even if your app evolves into something bigger – for instance, if you start as a meditation app and eventually grow to become a full mindfulness app – you’ll see that your addressable market increases, too.\\n\\n## What is SOM?\\n\\nSOM – Serviceable Obtainable Market – represents the market that you can actually expect to target to convert. To calculate your SOM , you would need to consider factors such as market trends, the competitive landscape, and potential customer interest in your specific app. Unlike SAM, SOM considers your business’s realistic constraints and limitations, such as budget, resources, and capabilities. By understanding your SOM, you can set more achievable and accurate revenue goals for your mobile app.\\n\\nFor our meditation app example, estimating SOM would mean looking at the following factors:\\n\\n- **The app’s competitive landscape:** The most popular apps in any niche own most of the market share and revenue. So to start with, especially if you’re going after a competitive, money-making app niche, you need to understand the market share that you can realistically capture, given the shares that the most popular apps already own. If 95% of your app’s SAM already uses a leading meditation app for their meditation, you’re looking at a much smaller market. Factoring in the competition helps you calculate your SOM more realistically.\\n- **Your marketing bandwidth.** With SAM analysis, you’ll know exactly the market you can reach. But your marketing bandwidth plays a role in whether you can effectively reach the identified market share. If you have limited resources for marketing, your SOM may be smaller than initially anticipated.\\n- **Consumer behavior.** Your market’s buying behavior also influences you SOM. To estimate SOM, you must know what percent of your identified market will be willing to spend money on a mobile app (as that’s the share you’re after). Looking at the share of paying users across your niche can help estimate this. You’d need to understand your market’s general retention patterns as they tell how loyal your market can be. You might have to invest in research to find these out.\\n\\n**Macro trends would be another important consideration.** Macro trends can also impact your estimation of SOM, as shifts in the economy or industry can affect consumer spending habits. It’s important to consider these external factors when projecting your market share.\\n\\n## Market Sizing for a mobile app using TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses\\n\\nAdding TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses to your app marketing forces you to critically evaluate constraints like your funding and competition, allowing you to set realistic goals. These analyses also help position your app for sustainable growth by avoiding reliance on generalizations.\\n\\n[TAM, SAM, and SOM](https://blog.funnelfox.com/tam-sam-som-for-mobile-growth/) analyses continue to offer value even as your app evolves. As your app grows, you might see that your SOM is growing to include more of your SAM — for example, when more users learn about your app.\\n\\nNot just that, you might even decide to optimize your SAM by offering your app in more languages — by expanding to non-English speaking markets, for instance.\\n\\nYou may also discover that your TAM is larger than initially anticipated, leading to new opportunities for expansion.\\n\\nIn all, TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses can give a roadmap for strategic decision-making at all stages of an app’s growth funnel.\\n\\nLet’s now see how you can perform TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses for your app.\\n\\n## How to calculate your mobile app’s TAM, SAM, and SOM\\n\\n### Using the top-down approach\\n\\nIn the top-down approach to estimating TAM, SAM, and SOM, you start by including everyone who could potentially use your app in your TAM analysis.\\n\\nThen, you narrow it down to SAM by considering factors like demographics, geographic location, and purchasing power.\\n\\nFinally, you further refine it to SOM by factoring in your app’s unique value proposition and the competitive landscape.\\n\\nThe top-down approach for calculating TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses allows you to estimate your app’s market potential without relying on specific data, making it a handy tool for preliminary analysis. However, for the same reason, the top-down approach will almost always produce market sizing that may not reflect the real-world market because it relies heavily on broad assumptions and generalizations. So, validating these estimates with real data is important as you progress further into your business planning process.\\n\\n### Using the bottom-up approach\\n\\nIn the bottom-up approach to estimating TAM, SAM, and SOM, you start by calculating your SOM based on your existing user base.  If you use a [revenue management solution like Adapty for your app](https://adapty.io/), you probably already know who your paying users or subscribers are.\\n\\nIf your app is new or you don’t have enough sales data, define targeted segments that represent potential paying users using filters for demographics, behavior patterns, and geographic locations.\\n\\nNext, estimate your SAM by adding realistically accessible users, building from your known segments.\\n\\nFinally, expand to TAM by including all potential users.\\n\\nThis method provides a more accurate market estimate since it’s based on real data or targeted segments, unlike the top-down approach that relies on broad assumptions. This leads to a more precise and realistic market analysis.\\n\\n## Wrapping it up…\\n\\nConducting thorough TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses helps you realistically understand your app’s growth potential. For many niche apps, calculating TAM, SAM, and SOM might show that the app may only reach a few thousand subscribers, which isn’t a bad thing at all if the market is actually willing to commit to subscriptions.\\n\\nBut remember that these numbers can change over time as the market evolves and user preferences shift. It’s important to regularly reassess and update your market sizing analysis.\\n\\nAnd as we saw, the bottom-up approach tends to be more accurate. Since the bottom-up approach to estimating your TAM, SAM, and SOM needs your user spending behavior data, consider adding a [revenue analytics solution](https://adapty.io/revenue-analytics/) like Adapty to your app. This way, you’ll get a really accurate picture of your SOM and eventually your SAM and TAM.

After all, the saying goes _“first impression is the last impression,”_ for a reason! And with over 2 million apps out there on Google Play Store and App Store, it’s more important now than ever.\\n\\nBut how do you exactly create the best app icon ever?!\\n\\nIn this guide, we’ll take you through the crucial elements of app icon design, including color, shape, and visual style, and show you how to optimize your app icons for different app stores. We’ll also share tips on using A/B testing to refine your design and create a mobile app icon that resonates with your target audience.\\n\\n## What is an app icon?\\n\\nIn simple words, an app icon is an image or symbol that shows up in a phone’s application menu to represent a specific mobile app. It’s an identifying marker for that app and acts as a recognizable brand image that users associate with the mobile app itself!\\n\\nJust the way people associate your face with you, an app icon is an important identity for an app.\\n\\nTherefore, your own app icon is a critical component of a mobile application’s design and success. And so an eye-catching icon can play a significant role in driving your CTR (click-through rates), user engagement, and downloads!\\n\\n## Essential elements of app icon design\\n\\nAs you go through the app icon design stages one by one, keep a few essential elements in mind. Not only have Apple and Google clearly emphasized their importance in their own press releases, but you’ll also hear famous app developers swear by these design elements too!\\n\\n### Color and contrast\\n\\nWhen it comes to your own app icon design, color, and contrast are essential elements that can greatly impact the icon’s visibility and appeal. The right color scheme can help your icon stand out from the competition and attract users. However, it’s important to choose visually appealing colors while staying on-brand for your app.\\n\\nWhen it comes to contrast, don’t take it lightly either. It helps ensure that the icon is easily recognizable and distinguishable, even in tiny sizes. By using contrasting colors or adding borders, you can make your app icon pop and increase its visibility on the app store.\\n\\nFor example, the [Spotify app icon](https://fabrikbrands.com/spotify-logo-history-spotify-symbol-meaning/) uses a bold green color that contrasts with the black background, making it instantly recognizable. Plus, with the iconic use of sound waves to depict what the app is about, Spotify leaves little in the way of confusion.\\n\\n![image 8](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-8-1024x684.png)\\n\\n### Shape and composition\\n\\nThe shape and composition of your app icons can greatly influence how users perceive your app. The right shape can convey a sense of professionalism or playfulness, while the wrong shape can be confusing or off-putting.\\n\\nBut what do they mean? Composition refers to the way in which different elements within the icon are arranged in the space provided. And the shape is… well, shapes!\\n\\nFor example, the Evernote app icon uses a simple, clean shape that communicates its note-taking functionality. The Instagram app icon, on the other hand, uses a fun, rounded shape that complements the playful nature of the app.\\n\\nWhen designing your mobile app icon, it’s important to consider the overall composition as well. A cluttered or overly complex design can be difficult to recognize at smaller sizes, while a simple and balanced composition can help your icon stand out.\\n\\nHere are some quick tips about the shape and composition of your own app icon to check off as you create one:\\n\\n- Keep your icon minimally cluttered.\\n- Use shapes that are relevant to your app’s function or brand.\\n- Pay attention to the symmetry and balance of your design.\\n- Consider using negative space to generate a dynamic composition.\\n\\n### Visual style and branding\\n\\nI mentioned this earlier but I’ll say it again! Your own app icon is the face of what your brand has to offer users. Using a somber visual style with dull colors for a playful social media app is a recipe for disaster. Why? Because it’s simply not giving you an accurate brand image.\\n\\nThe visual style and branding of your app icon are essential elements of app icon design that can significantly impact user engagement. A well-designed app icon that incorporates your brand identity can help to:\\n\\n- Build brand recognition,\\n- Establish credibility, and\\n- Communicate the unique value proposition of your app to potential users.\\n\\nWhen designing your app icon, consider incorporating elements of your app’s overall visual style. This can create a cohesive and consistent brand identity across all touchpoints. Here are some elements that count as important parts of your visual style:\\n\\n- Color scheme,\\n- Typography,\\n- Logo,\\n- Imagery.\\n\\nYou may also want to consider incorporating visual metaphors or symbols that relate to the app’s purpose and functionality, further reinforcing your brand identity and enhancing the user experience. For example, if your brand has a specific and recognizable logo or symbol, consider incorporating it into the icon to reinforce brand recognition.\\n\\nIn the end, you have an app that stands out in the crowded app marketplace of today and drives downloads and user engagement.\\n\\n### App icon design checklist\\n\\n| Design Aspect | Best Practice | Why It Matters |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Simplicity** | 1-2 main elements, no text | Scales better and increases recognizability |\\n| **Contrast** | Use high-contrast colors | Improves visibility at small sizes |\\n| **Color palette** | 2–3 colors max | Avoids clutter; stronger brand recall |\\n| **Scalability** | Test at small sizes (e.g., 29×29 px) | Ensures icon remains legible |\\n| **Brand consistency** | Align with app’s visual identity | Enhances recognition |\\n\\n## Optimizing your app icon for different app stores\\n\\nNow that you’re familiar with what makes an iconic app icon— pun intended— let’s talk optimization. Did you know that according to multiple [G](https://www.storemaven.com/glossary/what-google-play-store-listing-experiments/) [oogle Experiments](https://www.storemaven.com/glossary/what-google-play-store-listing-experiments/), about 80% of app icons fail in generating clicks?\\n\\nOptimizing your app icons for different app stores is crucial for gaining maximum visibility and downloads. These rules and regulations make a great impact so it’s better to keep them in mind while designing your app icons. However, the optimization process can differ depending on the app store, especially when it comes to iOS vs Android.\\n\\n### iOS vs. Android\\n\\nAh, the age-old war of Android versus Apple. Did you know it trickles down into app icons too? With both systems offering their users a unique vantage point of technology, they also have some stark differences to note. For instance, this is what the iOS app icons look like:\\n\\n![image 7](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7.png)_Icons for common iOS apps_\\n\\nOn the other hand, this is what a regular Android icon pack looks like:\\n\\n![image 5](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5.png)_Icons for common Android (Samsung) apps_\\n\\nHere are some of the key differences between iOS and Android app icon design guidelines:\\n\\n- **Shape:** iOS icons are designed to have rounded corners, while Android icons have square corners.\\n- **Size:** iOS icons should be 180 x 180 pixels for iPhone and iPad, while Android icons should be 192 x 192 pixels.\\n- **Grid system:** Android icons should follow a grid system to ensure they scale well on different devices, while iOS icons have more flexibility in terms of layout.\\n- **Shadows:** iOS icons should have a subtle drop shadow, while Android icons should not.\\n- **Visual style:** iOS icons tend to have a flatter, more minimalist design style, while Android icons often incorporate more texture and depth.\\n\\nRead up some more on [how Apple describes their app icons’ best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons).\\n\\n### App Store vs. Google Play\\n\\nIf you thought the differences were over, think again! When optimizing your app icon, it’s essential to consider the design guidelines and requirements of both the App Store and Google Play.\\n\\nThe App Store generally favors clean, minimalist designs with bold shapes and colors, while Google Play allows for more complex designs with detailed graphics and shading. In terms of size, the App Store requires a 1024×1024-pixel icon, while Google Play only requires a 512×512-pixel icon.\\n\\nAccording to a study by StoreMaven, icons that perform well on the App Store tend to have simpler designs with fewer details and less text. On the other hand, icons that perform well on Google Play tend to have more complex designs with more details and text.\\n\\nHere’s a quick summary of the differences you need to keep in mind when considering your own app icons for Google Play and App Store:\\n\\n| Specification | iOS | Android |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Required Base Size** | 1024 × 1024 px PNG | 512 × 512 px PNG |\\n| **Scaling / density versions** | Auto-generated by Apple | Multiple densities required (MDPI, HDPI, XHDPI, etc.) |\\n| **Transparency allowed** | No | Yes |\\n| **Corner shape** | Rounded by system | Adaptive / shape-mask supported |\\n| **Color profiles** | sRGB recommended | sRGB recommended |\\n\\n## A/B testing your app icon design\\n\\nDo you have a prototype ready to launch? Before you make it official, don’t forget to test your own app icon with the A/B testing method! A/B testing allows you to compare different versions of your icon and determine which one resonates best with your target audience.\\n\\nTo make it even better, I’ll give out handy tips on how to conduct effective A/B tests and use the results to refine your own app icon for maximum impact.\\n\\nBut before I jump into the technical tidbits, do you know…\\n\\n### What is A/B testing?\\n\\nA/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two different versions of something to determine which one performs better.\\n\\nImagine you want to know which candy to stock up on for Halloween. You pick 2 famous brands of candy and survey the neighborhood kids to pick their favorites. At the end of the day, you can simply tally the score and know the clear winner.\\n\\nIn the context of app icon design, A/B testing involves creating two different versions of an app icon and showing them to different groups of users to see which one results in more downloads or engagement.\\n\\nBy measuring the results, app developers can make informed decisions about which design is more effective and use it to improve the overall performance of their app.\\n\\n### Why A/B testing is important\\n\\nIf I told you that A/B testing is perhaps the most important part of this entire process, I wouldn’t be lying. In fact, A/B testing can help you yield more benefits than you’d realize at first.\\n\\nHere are 5 reasons why you need to conduct A/B testing for your customized icon is absolutely important.\\n\\n#### Helps choose the perfect icon with valuable insight\\n\\nA/B testing allows you to compare different app icon designs and choose the one that performs the best in terms of driving downloads and user engagement. It also provides valuable data and insights into user behavior and preferences, allowing you to make data-driven decisions about your app icon design.\\n\\n#### Improves user experience\\n\\nBy testing different designs, you can gather data on which app icon resonates with users and improves their overall experience with your app. There’s nothing as crucial as unlocking your user’s minds to provide them with an app they actually want!\\n\\n#### Saves time and money\\n\\nA/B testing can help you identify design flaws early on, allowing you to save time and money that would otherwise be spent on costly design revisions. Instead of paying correctional fees for recreating app icons, you can immediately identify what needs to change for a better result!\\n\\n#### Increases conversion rates, app downloads, and revenue\\n\\nA/B testing allows you to optimize your app icon design to increase conversion rates and attract more users to your app. Once your click-through rates improve and you reach a larger audience, your app downloads will see a spike upwards.\\n\\nAutomatically, this will improve your app performance in the app store, leading to increased revenue!\\n\\n#### Keeps you ahead of the competition\\n\\nBy constantly testing and improving your app icon design, you can stay ahead of the competition and attract more users to your app. A/B testing gives you the edge to beat your competitor’s app icon designs and create custom icons that have the potential to become one of the popular apps!\\n\\n### Best practices for A/B testing\\n\\nBeing a key element of any marketing strategy, market research comes with its unique list of best practices. Why wouldn’t you want to make data-driven decisions?\\n\\n![123](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/123.png)_You can test the shape and the style of your icon to find the one_\\n\\n[A/B testing](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-run-ab-tests-on-mobile-paywalls/) is no different than the others and there are several best practices I highly recommend you implement when you’re testing the waters!\\n\\n- **Test one variable at a time:** To accurately measure the impact of a specific change, only test one variable at a time.\\n- **Use a large enough sample size:** A small sample size may not be representative of your app’s overall audience. Aim for at least 100 users per variation.\\n- **Randomly assign users to test groups:** Randomly assigning users to either the control group or test group will help ensure unbiased results.\\n- **Test across multiple devices:** Different devices can impact how your app icon is perceived, so test across various devices to ensure consistency.\\n- **Monitor your results over time:** Monitor your results over time to identify any trends or changes in user behavior.\\n- **Use a reliable A/B testing platform:** Use a reliable A/B testing platform to ensure accurate results and data analysis.\\n- **Interpret your results carefully:** Interpret your results carefully, and consider all factors that may have influenced your test outcomes, including external factors such as seasonality or marketing campaigns.\\n\\n## Take your app to the next level with Adapty\\n\\nAfter drafting, trials, and tests, it’s time to push your app out to the world.

Additionally, A/B testing can help refine your design and ensure that your app icon resonates with your target audience.\\n\\nBy following these best practices and continually refining your app icon design, you can establish a strong brand identity and stand out from the competition in the crowded app market.\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### What size should my app icon be?\\n\\nThe recommended icon size depends on the operating system you’re using. For iOS, your icon size should be 1024 x 1024 pixels. However, Android’s recommended icon size depends on the device. Usually, Android app icons are created in 4 sizes: 192 x 192 pixels, 144 x 144 pixels, 96 x 96 pixels, and 72 x 72 pixels.\\n\\n### How many colors should I use in my app icon?\\n\\nWhen it comes to choosing colors for your app icon, use only 2-3 colors to create a simple yet appealing brand design. Using too many colors can make your app icon look cluttered and confusing, and can also make it more difficult to scale the icon to different sizes. The colors should also be in contrast with the background!\\n\\n### Should I include text in my app icon?\\n\\nNo, you shouldn’t use text in your app’s icon as a general rule of thumb. A clean and simple design is more recognizable and scalable. However, you can include a unique identifier like your app’s initials to create better brand recognition. Facebook is an example of that!\\n\\n### Can I use stock images in my app icon?\\n\\nIt’s not recommended to use stock images in your app icon. App icons should be unique and reflective of your brand or app’s purpose. Using stock images can make your app icon appear generic and unmemorable. Using copyrighted images without permission can result in legal issues. It’s best to create a custom design or work with a designer to create a unique app icon.\\n\\n### How often should I update my app icon?\\n\\nUpdate your app icon when your brand logo or app design changes, or when platform design guidelines are updated. Consider user feedback and make changes when necessary to keep your app icon fresh and recognizable. Avoid updating your app icon too frequently to avoid confusion for users to establish a consistent brand identity.\\n\\n### Can I use the same app icon for both iOS and Android?\\n\\nWhile it is possible to use the same app icon for both iOS and Android, it’s better to create separate icons for each platform to ensure optimal visual appeal and compliance with platform-specific guidelines. Each platform has different requirements for size, shape, and format, and using a single icon may result in distortion or loss of detail.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

It’s not just about making quick money; it’s about building lasting relationships with your customers. LTV shows how much a customer will spend with your product over time — and how much you will learn.\\n\\nOf course, knowing the metric is one thing. Making sure it constantly grows is a completely different skill. In this guide, we go through the nitty-gritty of the LTV for SaaS products in general and subscription apps in particular: how to calculate it, how to benchmark it, and how to grow it. We hope to arm you with actionable insights and inspire you to work on your product. Let’s get started!\\n\\n## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)\\n\\nCustomer Lifetime Value (sometimes abbreviated as CLV, but LTV is a more common term) is all about how much money a business will make from a customer over time. It’s not just about one sale or subscription but the total cash a customer brings in while they are with your product: from the registration to the day they delete the account.\\n\\nIt’s important to look at how long customers stay and how much they pay during that time. Aiming for long-term relationships means focusing on good customer experiences and constant improvements. Happy customers stay longer, meaning more money for the business.\\n\\nThat’s why in most companies, LTV guides decisions on how to make the product better, where to spend money on marketing, and what keeps the customers around (or makes them leave and stop spending). Knowing this crucial metric helps you spend money wisely, making sure you’re investing in things that keep customers paying.\\n\\nFor Software as a Service (SaaS) companies (and that’s what subscription apps are to the end customers, essentially), knowing their LTV helps see the big picture. It’s not enough to just get new customers; keeping the existing ones engaged and returning to the app is key. Unlike traditional sales models, where a product’s value is realized in a single transaction, SaaS models thrive on ongoing subscriptions and customer engagement over time. LTV shines a spotlight on the long-term value of each customer, measuring not just what they spend today, but what they will contribute financially throughout their relationship with the service.\\n\\n![AXg zRL3IRlOmqDg9URhgOnnj5mhp0kqMdq6cqPZgK9dC8z9At6gBQJN PYFOr8xGwKyMdkhuJjDvuTExP2O hFbk210qvhb9nLgdQsdQFEfHdHrYcbZ IvV2dyU0SXY7NxKCYVUqKr6s YdMMX a38](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/AXg_zRL3IRlOmqDg9URhgOnnj5mhp0kqMdq6cqPZgK9dC8z9At6gBQJN-PYFOr8xGwKyMdkhuJjDvuTExP2O-hFbk210qvhb9nLgdQsdQFEfHdHrYcbZ_IvV2dyU0SXY7NxKCYVUqKr6s-YdMMX_a38)\\n\\n## Why is LTV important for subscription apps?\\n\\nUnderstanding LTV for subscription apps helps publishers grasp the true value of their customers beyond the initial sign-up or monthly subscription fee. It encourages companies to focus on long-term customer satisfaction, product improvement, and service excellence. And this long-term perspective is the key: retaining a customer in a subscription model is often more cost-effective than acquiring a new one. High LTV signals a healthy, sustainable business model where customers find continuous value in the service, leading to ongoing revenue streams.\\n\\nLifetime value should also inform strategic decisions regarding your app. For instance, if analysis shows that improving customer support or adding certain features can significantly increase LTV, developers can allocate resources more effectively to these areas. By focusing on increasing the lifetime value of each customer, developers can ensure a steady income flow and invest in future expansion with greater confidence. This emphasis on customer retention over mere acquisition helps build a loyal customer base, which is crucial for long-term success in the competitive app marketplace.\\n\\nThat’s why LTV is not just another industry metric; it’s a guiding principle. It underscores the importance of viewing customers as long-term partners rather than one-time buyers. In a business model reliant on subscriptions and customer loyalty, understanding and optimizing LTV is fundamental to nurturing customer relationships, making informed strategic decisions, and achieving sustainable growth.\\n\\n## What metrics do you need for LTV?\\n\\n[Calculating LTV for a subscription app](https://adapty.io/blog/customer-lifetime-value-ltv/) setting involves several key metrics. Tracking them is important in itself, precisely because they can signal important changes in LTV.\\n\\n**Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** calculates the average amount of revenue each customer contributes over a specific period. You can find this metric by dividing the total revenue by the number of customers in a certain period — say, a quarter or a year. ARPU is critical for LTV because it provides a baseline for understanding how much revenue, on average, a customer brings in. For subscription apps, of course, it will probably be close to the average subscription price [minus the store fees](https://adapty.io/blog/how-much-money-do-apps-make/).\\n\\n**Customer Lifetime (CLT)** measures the average time a customer continues to subscribe and pay for your SaaS product. This metric can vary significantly between businesses and is influenced by how well your business retains customers. It’s calculated based on the average tenure of a customer before they churn.\\n\\n**Customer Churn Rate** shows the share of the customers who cancel their subscriptions: essentially, 1 – Retention Rate. This metric is vital for calculating LTV because it directly impacts the customer’s lifetime: the lower the churn rate, the more time an average user will spend with the app, which increases their lifetime value. The metric is calculated as a percentage: just divide the number of customers lost during a certain period by the total number of customers you had at the start of the period and multiply by 100%.\\n\\n**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** stands for the all-encompassing cost of getting a new customer, with marketing and sales expenses included. While not directly used in the basic LTV calculation, it’s essential for understanding the profitability of a customer. Ideally, the LTV should be significantly higher than the CAC for a business to be sustainable.\\n\\n**Discount Rate.** In more advanced LTV calculations, especially those that take into account future revenues, a discount rate is applied to account for the time value of money. This is particularly relevant for subscription apps with high upfront costs or investments in customer acquisition and less frequent (for example, annual) recurring revenue. The discount rate (often the inflation rate, or its derivative of some kind) converts future revenue into present value, providing a more accurate picture of a customer’s worth.\\n\\nWith these metrics, subscription app developers can estimate the LTV of their customer base. And now that we have them at hand, let’s talk more about different calculation methods in the next part of this guide.\\n\\n![YF9Gn2fdNiXWin BlVU4w54FQdCHWi4toS98QKSnXynF7XX2rkX45vqh3S9RMRsuil1kcO8A6fLlHUv686Ui2RvaE4aTGP QBHQBU N8d2M KKtHMoBWtTy1dWZLo78kkfnvld34CvgyV wqJ2tqK0](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/YF9Gn2fdNiXWin__BlVU4w54FQdCHWi4toS98QKSnXynF7XX2rkX45vqh3S9RMRsuil1kcO8A6fLlHUv686Ui2RvaE4aTGP-QBHQBU_N8d2M-KKtHMoBWtTy1dWZLo78kkfnvld34CvgyV-wqJ2tqK0)\\n\\n## How to calculate LTV for SaaS business?\\n\\nCalculating Customer Lifetime Value for a subscription app or a general SaaS business can be done in several ways. Here, we limit our guide to two methods: one is simple and universal that helps you understand the logic of the metric, and the other is a bit more advanced, fine tuned to the subscription products. The latter is closer to the one [Adapty in its predictive models](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-predict-revenue-and-ltv/); albeit, this one you can calculate by hand without using econometric methods.\\n\\n### Simple Method\\n\\nThe simple method for calculating LTV uses three key metrics: Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), Customer Churn Rate, and Customer Lifetime. The formula for this method is:\\n\\nLTV = ARPU X Customer Lifetime, where:\\n\\n- ARPU is the average revenue generated per user over a specific period: as we discussed earlier, just divide the total revenue over the number of customers in a certain period;\\n- Customer Lifetime, which is 1/Churn Rate.\\n\\nHere’s an example: in a given month you gained 100 new users, and 20 left by the end of the month. The total revenue you’ve earned that month is $20 000. Plugging the numbers into the formula gives us:\\n\\n- average revenue per user ARPU: $20 000 / 100 = $200;\\n- churn rate: 20 / 100 = 0.2 (or 20%); that brings customer lifetime to 1/0.2 = 5 months (always keep in mind the length of the period you’re using in the calculations);\\n- lifetime value, then, is $200 x 5 = $1 000.\\n\\nA small, but important adjustment to the model might be accounting for the **customer acquisition cost** CAC: how much money you spent acquiring this user. For example, if it cost you $50 dollars to get a new customer, the actual LTV might be $1 000 – $50 = $950.\\n\\n### Advanced Method\\n\\nThe advanced method incorporates the discount rate for the time value of money, reflecting the principle that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future. This is more suitable for long-term projections and can provide a more nuanced view of LTV. The formula us:\\n\\nLTV = t=1nARPU (1-Churn Rate)t-1(1 + Discount Rate)t, where t is a time period (often a month), and n is the total number of periods over which revenue is expected (often a year, so n = 12).\\n\\nDon’t be afraid of how the formula looks. The notation just stands for sum, as we want to calculate the year-long Lifetime Value, adjusting for seasonal differences. Essentially, we just calculate the LTV with a simple method 12 times (one per each month) and then sum up the results, accounting for inflation or other expenses.\\n\\nLet’s keep with the same example, now accounting for a 0.5% discount rate (which is often the case, since the effective annual inflation rate in a country might be 6%). We’d need something like Google Sheets or Excel to calculate it properly, and the updated LTV here is roughly $912.\\n\\n## Calculating LTV with Adapty\\n\\nOf course, the more accurate you want to be in your [LTV predictions](https://adapty.io/ltv-prediction-model/), the more complex will be the formulas: and the more advanced must be the tools to be able to calculate. That’s where Adapty comes into play.\\n\\nAdapty is the go-to solution for monetizing subscription apps. It helps developers to greatly simplify the rollouts of paywalls and drive higher profits by constantly improving their apps’ performance and lowering the production costs with no-code solutions. By regularly AB-testing your paywalls you can find the one that converts better and thus brings more paying customers.\\n\\nAnother killer feature of the service, however, is [subscription analytics](https://adapty.io/subscription-analytics/). Adapty directly connects to the App Store and Play Store, so it can report data with a very high degree of accuracy. It analyzes cohorts (audience collected during a certain period of time) and tracks the key business metrics like revenue, retention, and average revenue per user.\\n\\nMore importantly, however, are the newly introduced [**LTV predictions**.](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-predict-revenue-and-ltv/) Adapty uses a series of machine learning algorithms and constant updates to provide a value that is as accurate as possible, based on the history of your app and the behavior (frequency and size of purchases, the share of paying customers) of your user base.\\n\\nStart using Adapty to introduce this technology to your app.\\n\\n![fim](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fim-xwfy5Q4VIgZHn09deNJDatC4_QMhmmxDBwAPCEouT4urhvQzbyiDioeTjB_FUXd4DtbTKKGHibml4UhS3jGMZlzexMFUuqQpQgEVpRoKmvRMqOrPbrwEh0P0N8pLnEAN3GhtO1jDzOx2yEfCTTM)\\n\\n## What is a good LTV for subscription apps?\\n\\nA “good” Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) varies for different verticals of apps and involves several factors, including business model, market segment, product type, and importantly, the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). We will provide some benchmarks later in the article, but here are the key factors you should pay attention to.\\n\\n### LTV to CAC Ratio\\n\\nOne of the most critical benchmarks for assessing LTV is the LTV to CAC ratio, sometimes denoted as ROMI (return on marketing investment). This ratio ensures that the cost of acquiring a customer is significantly lower than the value derived from them, indicating a healthy, scalable business model. A general rule is that a “good” LTV should be at least 3 times the CAC, but it’s okay to start with lower numbers during the first months of your app on the market.\\n\\n### Business Model and Pricing\\n\\nThe business model and pricing structure of a subscription app are also important. For example, apps with high-value, [enterprise-level solutions](https://adapty.io/for-enterprises/) might have a higher CAC but also significantly higher LTV due to larger contract values and longer customer lifetimes. Again, the ratio of gains to losses and its stability (or even growth) are more important.\\n\\n### Market Segment and Product Type\\n\\nDifferent market segments and product types can also influence the benchmarks for a good LTV. Niche products serving specific industries may enjoy higher LTV due to specialized needs and less competition. In contrast, more generic products in highly competitive markets might struggle to achieve the same levels of customer loyalty and value. The exceptions are mobile games, but even that industry is expanding slower these days.\\n\\n### Customer Retention and Expansion\\n\\nA good LTV is reflective of strong customer retention and the potential for account expansion. Subscription apps that offer additional value through upsells, cross-sells, or premium features can significantly increase the lifetime value of their customer base. High retention rates and the ability to grow customers over time are indicative of an app that delivers ongoing value, contributing to a higher LTV.\\n\\nIn summary, a good lifetime value is often a subject of a myriad of factors, including the LTV to CAC ratio, business model, market segment, and the retention metrics. When benchmarking, compare yourself to your peers in the industry and their subscription price:\\n\\n- a good lifetime for a game app is 4-6 months, for a basic subscription app – 12+ months and for a niche subscription app – 18+ months and more;\\n- with the average subscription price in the US of around $10 –30 per month, a typical LTV varies from $50 to $450, with certain exceptions of corporate users.\\n\\n## More on the LTV to CAC ratio\\n\\nFor any app, the LTV to CAC ratio shows how effectively you’re turning marketing spend into profitable customer relationships. Subscription apps need also take into account that the length of their customer relationship directly correlates to the revenue they get, so it’s in their interest to keep the user engaged and motivated for as long as possible. Conversely, you can allow yourself to spend a bit more on attracting a customer or a player if you know that they will ‘pay you back’ by staying loyal to you and to the subscription.\\n\\nThat is important to keep in mind when launching an ad or a user acquisition campaign. Often marketing sees only the short-term gains and focuses only on the cost per install (CPI), without taking into account the quality of that install. Often, a seemingly more expensive install (for example, from an influencer) leads to a more informed and motivated customer who is more likely to subscribe. Cheap installs from paid ads, on the other hand, might not always convert to paying customers.\\n\\nThat’s why paying attention to this ratio rather than the raw numbers is key: it sheds light on whether your strategies for bringing in new customers are paying off. Of course, if you’re spending more on acquisition than what you’re earning from customers, your business might not be sustainable in the long term: allow, however, some time for the return on your investment and work on upselling the existing customers.\\n\\nAs we said before, an ideal LTV to CAC ratio is at least 3:1, indicating you’re earning three times what you’re spending to acquire customers. This sweet spot shows that your customer acquisition strategy is efficient and profitable. A ratio of 2:1 is on the lower end but still acceptable, suggesting your business is profitable but with limited room for additional expenses or errors.\\n\\n## Tips to increase customer lifetime value\\n\\nBoosting the lifetime value of your app can be approached with several practical strategies:\\n\\n**Improve product value.** Regularly update your app based on customer feedback, add new features, and ensure smooth operation. Like nurturing a garden, continuously improving your product keeps customers engaged and satisfied.\\n\\n**Enhance customer experience.** Make every customer interaction delightful, from sign-up to support. Offer personalized service, user-friendly design, and proactive engagement to make customers feel valued and supported.\\n\\n**Implement upselling and cross-selling.** Introduce customers to additional features or premium plans that complement their current use. Ensure these subscription offers are relevant and demonstrate their value to encourage upgrades.\\n\\n**Focus on customer retention.** Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Use loyalty programs, discounts for longer-term subscriptions, engaging content, and community-building efforts to keep customers engaged and loyal over time.\\n\\n**Leverage data for decision making.** Analyze customer behavior, feedback, and usage patterns to make informed improvements to your product and customer journey. Data-driven strategies lead to more effective enhancements in LTV.\\n\\nWhile these strategies might sound universal and vague, a lot of ‘unique’ problems of certain apps often fall into one of these categories. Single out a subscription offer, try to evaluate in which part of the funnel customers tend to ‘fall out’, and you will see that it’s often either an issue of lacking value, or an uncomfortable experience. Cultivating a higher LTV is an ongoing journey with many steps that requires dedication, innovation, and a keen focus on delivering exceptional value to your customers.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUnderstanding and optimizing Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is one of the more important goals to keep in mind. It’s the measure that shows the total value a customer brings to your business over time, guiding you toward sustainable growth strategies. From improving your product’s value and customer experience to smart upselling and focusing on retention, each strategy plays a vital role in enhancing LTV.\\n\\nA thriving subscription app has many moving parts: it requires continuous care and strategic nurturing. Keep a close eye on your metrics, listen to your customers, and be ready to adapt your strategies as needed. By doing so, you’ll not only increase the value each customer brings but also build a stronger, more resilient business.\\n\\nLet LTV be your north star, guiding you to make informed decisions that drive growth and profitability, and LTV/CAC ratio the speed at which you travel. With dedication and a focus on delivering exceptional value at every step of the customer journey, the potential is limitless. Keep growing, keep refining, and watch your app grow.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

However, not everyone is willing to commit to a monthly or an annual payment without having a test drive of an app or a service. That’s where the free trials come in: but even they don’t deliver a 100% success rate.\\n\\nThis article explains probably the most important metric for subscription apps: the free trial conversion rate. We at Adapty constantly help our customers to keep this number high with tools like [Paywall Builder](https://adapty.io/paywall-builder/) and [A/B Price Testing](https://adapty.io/paywalls-ab-testing/). That being said, there are still some evergreen basics and industry insights we thought were worth sharing.\\n\\n![63b3b9c002b0c73c5ba12206 Free%20Trial%20Conversion%20Rate%20formula](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fcdef3cc7cf1d1e14b4ba0c/63b3b9c002b0c73c5ba12206_Free%20Trial%20Conversion%20Rate%20formula.jpg)\\n\\n## What is a free trial conversion rate?\\n\\nThe **free trial conversion rate** is the percentage of users who, after having used a free trial of an app, choose to become paying subscribers. This metric is crucial for evaluating the retention strategies your app employs to hold onto its users and convert them into paying customers.\\n\\nA high conversion rate usually shows that users find value in the app’s premium features and are willing to pay for continued access. A low rate, on the other hand, might signify a disconnect between user expectations and the reality. Understanding this rate enables app developers and marketers to fine-tune their offers and promo strategies to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.\\n\\n## How to calculate the trial conversion rate\\n\\nCalculating the trial conversion rate is intuitively easy: divide the number of people who purchased the subscription after the trial by the total number of people who started the free trial in the first place. Multiplying this number by 100% will give the rate.\\n\\nFor example, out of 15,000 people who used the free trial, 1,200 decided to purchase the subscription. 1200/10000 \\\\* 100% gives us a 12% free trial conversion rate.\\n\\n![trial conversion rates](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/conversion-rate-1024x688.png)\\n\\n## Why is it important to track your conversion rate?\\n\\nTracking your conversion rate is crucial for optimizing the monetization strategies of your app. It’s the key way to influence ROI, especially when you’re strapped for cash and on a limited promo budget.\\n\\nThe rate is invaluable for financial planning and revenue forecasting, helping you understand how much you can afford to invest in customer acquisition – as is, what’s the highest cost per user (CPU) you can afford — and what the expected return on that investment, ROI, might be.\\n\\n## Types of app free trials\\n\\nThere are several monetization models, each with its pros and cons. Let’s see which one works better for your app.\\n\\n### Freemium\\n\\nThe term “freemium” is a blend of “free” and “premium,” and it refers to a business model where basic services or features are provided for free, while more advanced or additional features are available at a cost. In a freemium model, there is no time limit on the free features; users can continue to use them indefinitely. The goal is to attract users with the free offerings and then upsell the premium features once they are engaged.\\n\\n### Limited-time free trial\\n\\nIn this model, users are given access to most or all of the product’s features but only for a limited period, such as 7, 14, or 30 days. After the trial period expires, users must pay to continue using the service. Limited-time free trials are designed to give prospective customers a full experience of the service, incentivizing them to become paying subscribers once they’ve seen the value it can provide.\\n\\n### Opt-in free trial\\n\\nIn this instance, users are not automatically converted to paid subscribers at the end of the free trial period. Instead, they must actively choose to continue using the service by opting into a paid subscription. If they take no action, their access to the premium features simply expires. While this approach may yield a lower conversion rate, it tends to create a subscriber base of users who are more committed, as they have made a conscious decision to continue using the service.\\n\\n### Opt-out free trial\\n\\nIn contrast, opt-out trials automatically switch users to a paid subscription after the expiration of the trial, unless the user explicitly decides not to. This model depends on the inertia of users, many of whom might continue with the paid subscription either out of satisfaction or because they forget to cancel before the trial ends. While this may lead to higher conversion rates, it can also result in customer dissatisfaction if users feel they were unknowingly charged.\\n\\n## Trial conversion rate benchmarks\\n\\nObviously, the higher your free trial conversion rate, the better. And there are some great cases: for example, Slack [converts](https://medium.com/@cloudapp/how-slack-converts-30-of-their-freemium-users-into-paid-customers-b36081b18734) 30% of its free users, Vimeo converts 60%, and Netflix – a [whopping 93%](https://www.netomi.com/5-customer-experience-strategies-to-learn-from-netflix).\\n\\nBe prepared, however, that your app might have a way lower conversion rate for a while.\\n\\nMost SaaS companies enjoy a relatively low visit-to-trial rate, but higher trial-to-paid conversion rates that often range from 15% to 25%, with top-performing companies getting up to 60% of their trial users to become paid customers.\\n\\nFor most paid apps, the number fluctuates from 3 to 10%, depending on the necessity of the content and the availability of similar features not hidden behind a paywall. Some outliers, like Spotify, have a [conversion rate of up to 46%](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/why-marketers-should-consider-the-freemium-business-model/), but here we’re talking about strong branding and evident benefits to convert like the lack of ads and the ability to download music on a device.\\n\\nThe matter of carefully choosing what to offer for free and what to keep paywalled is even more evident in the case of Duolingo, which, despite the industry-defining user retention techniques and worldwide recognition, has only a [5% conversion rate](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/duolingos-s-1-depicts-heady-growth-monetization-new-focus-on-english-certification). Not only this app has introduced a paid tier later in its lifetime, but it also keeps the majority of its features available for free.\\n\\nThis number is actually a standard for most apps, with games having an even lower (around 1–2%) conversion rate. Whatever your app is, it makes sense to focus more on the growth of this metric rather than its given state. So let’s talk about how to improve this number.\\n\\n## Tips to improve your app’s trial conversion rate\\n\\nImproving conversion rates for in-app trials involves multiple strategies that address the user experience, the value proposition, and user engagement. Here are some actionable techniques:\\n\\n01. **Onboarding Experience:** Design an intuitive and user-friendly onboarding process that quickly shows the value of your app. Use tooltips and walkthroughs to guide users through essential features.\\n02. **Value Demonstration:** Make sure that users can quickly experience the value of your premium features. Place core functionalities upfront and enable easy-to-find “upgrade” options. You can also do it with [different paywalls](https://adapty.io/paywall-builder/), analyzing which features, when highlighted, convert the users better.\\n03. **Time-Sensitive Offers:** Leverage urgency by offering special discounts or added features if they upgrade before the trial ends. This can be particularly effective in the last few days of the trial.\\n04. **Push Notifications and Emails:** Use these channels to remind users of the benefits of upgrading and the time remaining in their free trial, especially when the trial is about to end. Make the messaging compelling and personalized.\\n05. **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different layouts, messages, or features exposed during the trial to see which configurations yield the highest conversion rates. Use the data to optimize your trial experience continuously. Adapty has a specific tool for [A/B testing of the prices](https://adapty.io/paywalls-ab-testing/).\\n06. **Customer Support:** Offer robust customer support during the trial period, even using live chats in-app to help answer questions or solve problems in real time.\\n07. **Frictionless Conversion:** Make the process of moving from a free trial to a paid subscription as simple as possible. Avoid asking for unnecessary information, and make the transition seamless.\\n08. **Track Engagement Metrics:** Monitoring how users interact with your app can provide insights into what might persuade them to convert. Features that see heavy usage during trials are your main selling points.\\n09. **Retargeting Campaigns:** Use data analytics to identify users who didn’t convert and retarget them with special offers or surveys that can give insights into why they chose not to subscribe.\\n10. **Analyze Churn Data:** Examine the reasons why users decide not to convert after the free trial. Use this data to address issues in your app or its value proposition.\\n\\nBy implementing these strategies and continuously monitoring their impact through relevant KPIs, such as the trial conversion rate and the churn rate, you can significantly grow your app revenue.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe trial conversion rate is a critical metric for any business offering in-app trials as part of its monetization strategy. It serves as a valuable indicator of the effectiveness of your trial in turning users into paying customers. Tracking this KPI, along with related metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), and Churn Rate, offers a holistic view of your app’s performance.\\n\\nEmploy strategies such as optimizing the onboarding experience, leveraging time-sensitive offers, and conducting A/B testing to enhance your conversion rates. A data-driven approach and continual iterations based on performance metrics will help you fine-tune your app to maximize both customer satisfaction and revenue. So, if you’re looking to make the most out of your in-app trials, focusing on improving your trial conversion rate should be a top priority.\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### What is a good conversion rate for a free trial?\\n\\nWhile it depends greatly on the industry, platform, and even the country, aim for 5% as a new product. A more established service can be ambitious and try to reach an 8–10% conversion rate.\\n\\n### How do you calculate the trial conversion rate?\\n\\nDivide the number of paying subscribers by the number of people who requested the trial, and then multiply by 100%.\\n\\n### How do I increase my trial conversion rate?\\n\\nConstantly experiment with offers and paywalls, analyze what features are requested and used by more people, and what are the causes of churn.\\n\\n### What is a good cost-per-conversion rate?\\n\\nOnce again, numbers vary for different genres and countries. For a typical non-gaming app in the US, having it around $ 40-50 USD is usually a good sign. Obviously, the number should be lower than the subscription margin for you to be profitable.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Of course, no specific number can be named — the overwhelming majority of apps on mobile platforms collect virtual dust, with just a relatively small part being the top earners in their field. Nevertheless, new publishers pop up every day: and in a market that will grow [13% year to year,](https://straitsresearch.com/report/mobile-app-development-market#:~:text=Mobile%20App%20Development%20Market%20size%20will%20grow%20at%20approx.,12.8%25%20during%20the%20forecast%20period.) there’s always a place for a new player.\\n\\nThat’s why we decided to develop the ultimate app revenue guide that answers all the basic questions about the industry, and then some. Adapty is the best solution to grow mobile in-app purchases, and our expertise comes from thousands of clients enjoying our platform, as well as millions of A/B tests being launched on it monthly. With this guide, we plan to give you enough information to come up with a sound business plan for your future app.\\n\\nFirst, we will get and learn the difference between proceeds, revenue, and profits. Then, we will see what parts of your product’s income are given to the partners and governments, and how to account for that. And for the final kick, we will check out several ways to boost your incoming cash flow, including optimizing pricing strategies and tracking financials. This way you will learn not just how much money can you make from an app, but how you can make _more_. Let’s go!\\n\\n## Revenue vs. Proceeds\\n\\n[Adapty](https://adapty.io/subscription-analytics/) helps developers monitor and optimize their subscription-based business models, which is crucial for growing both [mobile app revenue](https://adapty.io/performance-analytics/) and proceeds. But to be able to do this, we first need to make sure we understand and know the difference between the two terms.\\n\\nRevenue and proceeds are two financial terms that, while related, have distinct definitions and applications. **Revenue** is the total amount of money your service earns from all sources possible: ads, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. It’s essentially the gross income a business makes before any expenses are deducted.\\n\\n**Proceeds**, on the other hand, refer to the net amount a developer receives from their app after all direct costs related to a transaction have been subtracted. The two basic direct costs we need to keep in mind are the App Store commissions and taxes, both of which we will cover later in this guide.\\n\\n![1 1](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-1.png)\\n\\nConsider the App Store or Google Play Store. When a developer sells a $10 app, the revenue from that sale is $10. If the App Store takes a 30% cut (and it usually does), or $3, the proceeds that the developer gets would be $7. While the revenue indicates the total sales, the proceeds provide a more accurate measure of the developer’s actual earnings.\\n\\nUnderstanding the distinction between these terms is vital for app developers, particularly those operating on a subscription-based model. The total **mobile app revenue** can provide insight into the app’s market appeal and the effectiveness of marketing strategies. Meanwhile, the **proceeds** can inform the developer about the real profits being made, accounting for app store commissions and other direct costs.\\n\\nAdapty [provides comprehensive subscription analytics](https://adapty.io/subscription-analytics/) to help developers track and interpret these numbers. By offering insights into key metrics like revenue, proceeds, and conversion rates, Adapty empowers developers to make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and app development strategies. With a clear, data-based picture, developers can better strategize on ways to increase their app’s profitability and long-term success.\\n\\n## Understanding VAT\\n\\nAs we mentioned earlier, App Store commissions and taxes are the two key direct costs every app developer should be wary of. Not only do they take the biggest cut off your app revenue, but they are also the hardest to change or influence. Let’s start, however, with the most popular tariff.\\n\\n**Value Added Tax (VAT)** is a consumption duty levied on a product whenever value is added at each stage of the supply chain. Its key principle is to tax the end consumer of goods and services while offering businesses a way to reclaim the money they have paid. This way the VAT is ultimately paid by the consumer, and not by the businesses involved in production.\\n\\nWith app sales and in-app purchases, VAT is applied based on the location of the user and is based on their country of residence. When a customer makes a purchase, the listed price they see already includes any VAT due. The App Store then deducts this VAT amount before the developer receives their **proceeds**.\\n\\n![2](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2.png)\\n\\nFor example, if a user in Italy purchases an app for €10. The VAT in his country of residence is 22%, so €2.2 of the purchase price is considered VAT. The developer’s net revenue is the remaining €7.8, from which the App Store takes its commission. In most cases, it’s 30%, so the final proceeds are €5.46.\\n\\nUnderstanding VAT and how it impacts the net mobile app revenue from app sales is crucial. It aids in setting appropriate pricing strategies and accurately forecasting earnings from different markets.\\n\\n### Collecting VAT for apps\\n\\nYes, App stores like Apple’s App Store and Google Play Store are in charge of collecting and paying VAT on your behalf. Technically, you “sell” your app to them, and they provide it to the end user, so they’re the last party responsible. The stores automatically add the VAT onto the price of apps and in-app purchases based on the customer’s location, collect the payments and send them to the relevant states.\\n\\nTherefore, developers don’t have to manage VAT collection directly. The proceeds you receive have already had taxes and store commissions deducted. Important to remember, however, that the prices the end users see have the commission and the VAT included. That’s why a flexible pricing strategy here is crucial and should consider local taxes, as well as any other income taxes your company might need to pay. Speaking of which…\\n\\n## Taxes on app income\\n\\nAs we saw before, taxes significantly impact the net earnings from app sales and in-app purchases. When calculating how much apps make, companies must consider these taxes to learn their actual profits. And if VAT is fixed and is calculated, collected, and paid by the app stores, other taxes are solely the developers’ responsibility and can prove to be tricky.\\n\\nIgnoring these deductions can lead to an overestimation of profits, inaccuracies in financial forecasting, and potential difficulties in sustaining the business.\\n\\nIn this part, we give a quick rundown of the most common taxes an app developer studio might have to pay. Needless to say, actual numbers might differ based on the country your company is located in, and the council of a professional accountant is advised.\\n\\n![4](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4.png)\\n\\n### Other taxes app developers should pay\\n\\nApp developers and publishers are subject to various types of taxes based on their business operations and location. The ones that most companies are subject to are the income tax and the sales tax.\\n\\n**The income tax** is levied on the **net profits** made by the business. In our case, remember, the net profits come after the App Store commissions and the VAT. Given our Italian case, the income tax will be calculated against €5.46 out of every €10 of your mobile app revenue. The tax rate charged depends on the country and sometimes the state in which the business operates.\\n\\n**The sales tax** may apply to app sales and in-app purchases. In many cases, app stores handle sales tax collection and remittance the way they do the VAT, but developers should still be aware of how these affect their revenues. If the sales tax is collected by the store, it’s also deducted from the gross revenue; if not, you are in charge of calculating, collecting, and paying the tariff. Sales taxes differ greatly, so be sure to learn the specifics.\\n\\nTax optimization for app developers deserves a separate guide altogether. For quick advice, however: in some jurisdictions and industries, app publishers can apply for the status of an innovative company or a startup, which usually implies lower or even zero sales tax and a simplified tax collection altogether. You would benefit from learning what options are available in your country of residence.\\n\\nRemember, failure to comply with tax obligations can result in significant penalties and damage to your business’s reputation. Therefore, understanding and meeting your tax responsibilities should be the top priority. The knowledge of how much your app makes is useful not just for a business model, but for the stability of the whole company.\\n\\n![3](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3.png)\\n\\n## App Store commissions and fees\\n\\nCommissions are the second direct cost all app developers should know. Introduced together with the App Store back in 2006, the sizeable cut is still a matter of heated debate. One of the most famous is [Epic Games v. Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple), where the developer of one of the world’s most popular – and profitable – mobile games sued the smartphone producer for the behavior it deemed anti-competitive.\\n\\nAnd knowing the actual numbers, you might understand their frustration. Typically, both Apple App Store and Google Play Store charge a commission of 30% on app purchases, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. If it seems big to you, that’s because it is; however, this is the rate you should keep as the go-to for all your app revenue calculations.\\n\\nTo soften the blow, both platforms have introduced reduced commission rates for smaller developers and subscriptions that are retained for over a year. For instance, under Apple’s App Store Small Business Program, developers earning less than $1 million per year pay a reduced commission of 15%. And both in App Store and Google Play, after a subscriber has been active for a year, the commission drops to 15%.\\n\\nLet’s take an example. If a developer sells an app for $10, the app store would take a commission of $3 (at the standard 30% rate), leaving the developer with $7. However, if the developer is eligible for the reduced 15% rate, the commission on a $10 sale would be $1.50, leaving the developer with $8.50.\\n\\n### Reducing App Store fees\\n\\nThe 30% commission is a significant cut of the profits, and most developers try to find a way to pay less. The go-to way is to follow the mobile platforms’ own rules: that is, stay a low-earning company or attract customers to be long-term subscribers. And while the first option is a sad business forecast, the second is an option we strongly recommend.\\n\\nIn fact, [Adapty](https://adapty.io/) was designed specifically for subscription-based apps that care about long-term results. It allows you to constantly adapt paywall offers that convert more people into paying customers, and keep customers loyal for several years. It’s one of the few solutions whose benefit can be clearly measured in money: For every loyal customer, you save 15% of the commission on the annual or monthly subscription.\\n\\nHere are some other options:\\n\\n- **Combining Several Pricing Models.** Developers can use several pricing models like freemium, paid apps, in-app purchases, or subscriptions. A [freemium model](https://adapty.io/all/blog/freemium-app-monetization-strategies/) attracts a large user base, and then premium features are used to monetize it through in-app purchases or subscriptions.\\n- **Optimize Pricing.** When choosing prices for the app and the in-app purchases, consider the target market’s purchasing power, competitor pricing, and the value provided by the app, as well as local taxes and fees.\\n- **Direct User Billing.** Although it has its complexities, some developers choose to bill users for their services directly, bypassing App Store fees. This approach has stringent guidelines and restrictions, especially with Apple, which is known for blocking apps that give a possibility to circumvent the system.\\n\\nHowever, for some of us, the changes are coming. Starting with iOS 17, [Apple is rumored to allow](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2023/04/21/ios-17-iphone-sideloading-is-coming-but-how-safe-is-it/) sideloading — installing apps not from the App Store — for users in the European Union. In theory, this would allow developers to charge for them without the 30% fee — but with the taxes remaining.\\n\\n## The best solution for understanding commissions and taxes\\n\\nRevenue, as a metric, is too general, as it shows the overall earnings of the app, and sometimes it may be challenging to understand the net income and plan your financial strategy as a result. That’s why Adapty allows you to check the revenue in 3 formats:\\n\\n- **Gross revenue**\\n- **Proceeds after store commission**\\n- **Proceeds after store commission and taxes**\\n\\n**Gross revenue** basically shows the overall earnings from your app, meaning that fees and taxes will be excluded from this amount later.\\n\\nThe **Proceeds after store commission** optiondisplays the revenue amount after deducting the store commission fee.\\n\\nConsequently, **Proceeds after store commission and taxes** is the net income, with all the commission fee and taxes already deducted.\\n\\n![image 22](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-22.png)\\n\\nThe most important aspect here is that **this 3-way viewing is applied to all revenue-related metrics,** such as Revenue, MRR (Monthly recurring revenue), ARR (Annual recurring revenue), ARPU (Average revenue per user), and ARPPU (Average revenue per paying user). Cohorts and LTV tabs also allow viewing of the data with regard to the store commission and taxes.\\n\\n![image 23](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-23.png)\\n\\nFind out more about [Adapty’s subscription analytics](https://adapty.io/subscription-analytics/) and take your growing strategy to the next level.\\n\\n## Pricing strategies and impact on earnings\\n\\nAre apps profitable? Yes, if you use the correct pricing model. It must strike a balance between being attractive to users and ensuring business viability. A price too low attracts users but limits revenue, while a high price can deter potential customers. The right price should cover costs (including app store fees and taxes), allow for profit, and reflect the app’s value to users.\\n\\nMost pricing strategies differ based on the app type: subscriptions are more profitable for apps offering continuous services, while a one-time purchase could be ideal for professional applications. Most games generate revenue from in-app purchases, and a lot of casual apps use a [freemium model](https://adapty.io/blog/freemium-app-monetization-strategies/). Here’s a quick rundown of the most popular pricing strategies.\\n\\n### Different pricing models\\n\\nThere are varying app monetizing strategies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses:\\n\\n- **Freemium.** The go-to option for most: the base version of the app is free, but users can pay for premium features or content. Such apps quickly attract a large user base due to the easiness of the free installation, but it relies on a portion of users seeing enough value in the premium features to pay for them.\\n- **Paid.** Easy to understand: pay for the app and use it for free later. This way you get immediate revenue per download, but the initial cost might deter potential users. There is also no recurring revenue unless you offer additional in-app purchases.\\n- **Subscription.** Subscription-based apps charge users a recurring fee, usually monthly or yearly, for access to the content. This model provides a consistent and predictable revenue stream. However, it requires developers to continually provide value to users, and marketers and UX designers to constantly experiment with paywalls and other offers. Luckily, [Adapty is designed](https://adapty.io/paywalls-ab-testing/) to do just that — and extremely well.\\n\\nChoosing the right pricing model depends on the type of your app, its target audience, and its value. You should find a delicate balance of how and how much your app makes, joggling between user acquisition, retention, revenue generation, and tax optimization.\\n\\n### How pricing models affect revenue, income, and taxes\\n\\nAs we’ve discussed before, subscriptions allow you to save with the lower App Store fees that start after 12 months of payments from an active user. That’s why more and more apps switch to subscriptions as their general pricing model.\\n\\nBoth paid apps and in-app purchases include the same App Store fees and taxes like VAT. However, with sideloading you will probably be allowed to collect payments by yourself. This way you won’t have to give 30% of your revenue to the mobile system — but you will have to collect and pay sales tax and VAT by yourself.\\n\\n## Tips for maximizing app earnings\\n\\nIncreasing how much your app makes is a never-ending process, with practices and lifehacks coming in style and losing their efficiency in a matter of months. Here are some long-term strategies to maximize both your mobile app revenue and proceeds.\\n\\n- **Improve App Quality and User Experience.** Goes without saying, yet is often missing. Prioritize intuitive design, ease of use, speed, and reliability. Use user feedback and data to identify pain points and make necessary improvements. An app or a game that’s joyous to use is also joyous to pay for.\\n- **Implement Complete Acquisition Strategies.** Running ads for your app on social media doesn’t always cut it. Be sure your acquisition campaign is all-encompassing: utilize [App Store Optimization (ASO)](https://adapty.io/blog/improve-app-visibility-in-app-store/) to make your app more discoverable, leverage owned media, and include influencers to reach your target audience.\\n- **Regularly Update and Optimize App Pricing.** Prices, currencies, taxes, and other economic factors change swiftly, and you should act accordingly. Always be on the lookout for the macroeconomic situation in your key markets so you know you’re not missing out on the currency differences or making your audience pay too much.\\n- **Explore Additional Monetization Strategies.** In addition to direct app sales or in-app purchases, consider other [monetization methods](https://adapty.io/blog/mobile-app-monetization-strategies/). In-app advertising can generate revenue, especially for free apps with a large user base, and partnerships or affiliate programs are a nice way to grow both revenue and the user base. For more on this, read our [article](https://adapty.io/blog/recurring-revenue-in-subscription-apps/) on recurring income.\\n\\n![5](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5.png)_[Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1119916/app-monetization-methods-united-states-app-publishers/)_\\n\\n## Tracking and analyzing app financials\\n\\nData is king, and monitoring and analyzing an app’s financials is vital for maintaining a profitable and sustainable business. A thorough analysis reveals trends and insights like the most profitable user demographics or most successful marketing campaigns, which guide future decision-making.\\n\\nApp Stores [provide a lot of data](https://adapty.io/blog/mobile-app-metrics/) for app developers to track and analyze, from average app revenue and proceeds, to churn rates and benchmarks. They also explain where and how much money your app makes, albeit their payments calendar is a bit tricky. For a clearer picture of the payout dates, check out our [Apple Fiscal Calendar guide](https://adapty.io/apple-fiscal-calendar/).\\n\\nAdapty is another great way to track financials, especially if you plan on having a subscription-based app. Our [cohort solution](https://adapty.io/cohorts/) allows the teams to not just see the purchases, but to analyze which product and audience segment perform better. By breaking down the proceeds by day and by renewal time and knowing what works and what doesn’t, you can adjust the app’s pricing strategies accordingly.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Make an app that makes money\\n\\nUnderstanding the intricacies of app earnings – including revenue, proceeds, VAT, and other taxes – is crucial for any app developer aiming to maximize income and ensure business sustainability. A comprehensive grasp of these concepts allows for accurate financial planning, strategic pricing, and effective tax management.\\n\\nVAT, taxes, and app store commissions significantly impact your net earnings. Being aware of these deductions and accurately calculating your net proceeds is key to setting appropriate pricing strategies and forecasting your income. Moreover, understanding and complying with tax obligations can prevent costly penalties and secure your business reputation.\\n\\nAccurate financial planning is not only about managing costs and taxes. It also involves continually optimizing your pricing strategy, improving your app’s quality, implementing effective marketing strategies, and exploring additional [monetization methods](https://adapty.io/blog/mobile-app-monetization-strategies/). These efforts contribute to higher user acquisition and retention, boosting your app’s profitability.\\n\\n[Adapty](https://adapty.io/) is a powerful tool for financial planning and optimization that will save you from calculating commissions and taxes from your app’s revenue.

Read all about it in Google News. That science book preview you read on Goodreads? Buy here on Amazon! A blueberry recipe you need to try out? Tap and Youtube start showing you the step-by-step of it.\\n\\nWhat all these situations have in common is their ability to utilize deep links to take you where you need to be, as quickly as possible, as smoothly as possible. And chances are, if you’re a mobile app developer, you need this more than you might realize.\\n\\nDeep links aren’t just plain URLs you can stick around to attract users to your app. No, it’s much more complex and deeper. So in this article, I want to emphasize what a mobile app deep link is, why it’s important, and how you can reap the sweetest results by implementing it in your app right now!\\n\\nSo let’s start with the basic question…\\n\\n![o3mRQz2GyJraaSQ0XymFM5 zK5RaYtyLFmOqg7TWGT8L trHOVF9lxDvjCqRrkdHQHLPy47q6QU4mgYpoh6Ubgg5ogb5kdaDdME4IMsGr4SR8MsGP Zk6Sjqwu8p pI ivFGlP5iTcHY28b2KaoqXJg](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/o3mRQz2GyJraaSQ0XymFM5_zK5RaYtyLFmOqg7TWGT8L_trHOVF9lxDvjCqRrkdHQHLPy47q6QU4mgYpoh6Ubgg5ogb5kdaDdME4IMsGr4SR8MsGP-Zk6Sjqwu8p_pI_ivFGlP5iTcHY28b2KaoqXJg)\\n\\n## What is mobile app deep linking?\\n\\nThe process of utilizing a custom URL to direct users to a specific page within an app is known as mobile [deep linking](https://adapty.io/glossary/deep-linking/). It allows users to bypass the app’s home screen and land directly on the desired location within the app.\\n\\nThis allows for a seamless transition from external sources, such as websites, search results, or other apps, to specific sections, features, or even personalized content within the app. There are many ways to execute a mobile deep link but here are a few common ways you might’ve come across a deep link:\\n\\n- Website URLs (search results, [links within blogs](https://adapty.io/blog/what-am-i-doing-wrong-with-my-subscription-ios-app-marketers-mistakes/), etc)\\n- Emails\\n- In-app URLs (social media posts or clickable redirects within an app)\\n- QR codes\\n- Push notifications (more on this later)\\n\\nBut this isn’t that simple! There are a few different [types of app deep linking](https://blog.funnelfox.com/deep-link-guide-web-to-app/) to keep in mind before you jump to a mobile deep link strategy for yourself.\\n\\n[![demo page 5 7](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/demo-page-5-7-1024x286.png)](https://adapty.io/schedule-demo/)\\n\\n### Types of deep linking\\n\\nYou can’t understand what deep linking in apps is without understanding the 3 types of mobile app deep links!\\n\\n#### Standard deep links\\n\\nA standard deep link is a URL or hyperlink that directs users to a specific location or screen within a mobile app. It allows users to bypass the app’s home screen and directly access a desired feature, content, or functionality within the app.\\n\\nThese links are often not personalized but are marketing a generic tone to a larger target audience. Take a deep link example for a pair of shoes you viewed on Amazon a few days ago.\\n\\nClicking on the link would open the shopping app and take you directly to the page displaying that particular pair of shoes. This eliminates the need for you to manually search or navigate through the app to find the product, providing a convenient and efficient user experience.\\n\\nHere is a simple deep link URL example. Notice how it opens the app instead of the browser on mobile devices:\\n\\n![l4K30NJ8rSkXVtlE5oyZCrfPxJjNQsh QWgithU10FdnHn9asnFkCwrEKnhi1JmrSrDqOhxIozQYYibj](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-l4K30NJ8rSkXVtlE5oyZCrfPxJjNQsh_QWgithU10FdnHn9asnFkCwrEKnhi1JmrSrDqOhxIozQYYibj-I2iPMx9hXtxzkSos_3Pljmve2ux8jPUIxiLxANIsTkX_8a9y886AKZIaKhqZCXG0HVTBk)\\n\\n#### Deferred deep links\\n\\nA deferred deep link redirects users to a specific in-app location or content after they install an app. When you click on a deferred deep link and don’t have the app installed, it will take you to the app store to download and install the app.\\n\\nAfter the app is installed– or if you already have it installed– it takes you to the specific screen or content you were initially interested in!\\n\\n#### Contextual deep links\\n\\nA contextual deep link incorporates a personal flair to a standard deep link, providing a personalized and relevant user experience with additional parameters. Have you ever come across an abandoned cart email from an online shopping app? That’s a contextual deep link!\\n\\nContextual deep links leverage user attributes, preferences, or behavior to tailor the in-app experience. With personalized deep-linking apps, user engagement and retention rates can experience a great boost.\\n\\n## History and evolution of mobile app deep linking\\n\\nThe concept of deep linking first gained attention around 2006 when it was used to describe providing search engines with visibility into web pages beyond the home page.\\n\\nHowever, during that time, deep linking was also associated with controversies related to copyright infringement and hotlinking, which linked directly to files hosted by third parties without permission.\\n\\nThe true potential of deep linking in the context of mobile apps began to emerge with the release of iPhone OS 2 (now iOS) by Apple in 2008. Developers could build applications for the iPhone and submit them to the new App Store.\\n\\nInitially, deep linking was primarily used to map web page items to the same item within an app. For example, if a user was reading an article on a website, deep linking enabled them to open the same article directly in the corresponding app.\\n\\nCompanies with extensive content, such as news apps, found deep linking particularly useful. They could seamlessly transition users from web content to the app, improving the user experience and providing a more efficient way to access specific articles or information.\\n\\nThis was especially valuable for apps with a large amount of content, as deep linking allowed users to bypass the need to manually navigate through various options.\\n\\nIn 2012, Google+ introduced app-to-app deep linking, showcasing the potential for seamless connections between different apps.\\n\\nFor instance, if a user clicked on a deep link in an email, it could open a specific section within a relevant app. This demonstrated the benefits of deep linking for app-to-app experiences and hinted at the possibilities for enhanced functionality and user engagement.\\n\\nBetween 2013 and 2014, the rise of mobile commerce created a strong need for better tools to drive users through the conversion funnel. Deep linking played a crucial role in this context.\\n\\nBrands and marketers started redirecting users from marketing emails and web ads to specific content within their mobile apps using deep links. This approach provided a higher likelihood of conversion and a better user experience compared to traditional mobile web interactions.\\n\\nFor example, a retail brand could use a deep link in an email campaign to direct users to a specific product within their app. This eliminated the need for users to search for the product manually, streamlining the path to purchase and increasing the chances of conversion.\\n\\nThroughout the years, deep linking has continued to evolve, with platforms like iOS introducing universal links that associate deep links with website domains in 2015. This allowed for a seamless handover between the web and the app, providing users with a consistent experience across both platforms.\\n\\n## Why is mobile app deep linking important?\\n\\nMobile app deep links are more than just an accessory. With a deep-linking mobile app, you are [setting your app to monetized success and beyond](https://adapty.io/blog/mobile-app-monetization-strategies/)!\\n\\nHere are just a few ways a deep link mobile app is something worth considering:\\n\\n### Improves the user experience\\n\\nMobile app deep linking significantly improves the user experience by providing seamless and direct access to specific content within the app. It eliminates the need for users to navigate through multiple screens or menus to find the information they seek. Instead, deep linking allows you to bypass irrelevant sections and land directly on the desired screen or feature.\\n\\nLet’s say you got a promotional email from Amazon about a limited-time discount for that one product you’ve been eyeing for a while. Thanks to deep linking, you’ll be able to tap on the link in the email and be directed straight to the product page.\\n\\nNo manual typing, searching, or scrolling is required!\\n\\nDeep linking also enhances contextual relevance within the app. By leveraging deep links, you can personalize the user experience further by directing users to content that matches their interests, preferences, or previous actions.\\n\\nFor instance, a music streaming app like Spotify can use deep linking to direct users to a personalized playlist based on their favorite genre or recently played songs. This level of personalization enhances user engagement and satisfaction which brings us to our next point…\\n\\n### Increases user retention, engagement, and usage rates\\n\\nMobile app deep linking is instrumental in increasing user retention, engagement, and usage rates by streamlining the user experience and providing seamless access to relevant content. In fact, Apps Flyer proves that [a deep link app can deliver over 30% in CTI rates](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/guides/deep-linking-101/) while generic journeys can score as little as 5% of the same conversion.\\n\\nThe reason is that users can quickly find what they are looking for, which increases their satisfaction and encourages them to return to the app. Not only have you improved user experience and navigation, but you’ve also increased their retention and usage rates!\\n\\nI want to point out that these 2 metrics are of the utmost importance if you’re looking to make money from your mobile app. If your subscribed users aren’t using the app anymore and you can’t retain them, that’s your money down the drain.\\n\\nP.S. Keep an eye out for retention, financial and conversion analytics with Adapty’s [subscription analytics](https://adapty.io/subscription-analytics/) and our updated [Cohorts](https://adapty.io/cohorts/)!\\n\\n### Onboards more users and increases app downloads\\n\\nSaying that a mobile app deep linking strategy isn’t pivotal in increasing those app download numbers and onboarding a whole new set of users would be a lie. Allow me to explain how.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why an app might have a high drop-off rate despite having a great marketing strategy is that your onboarding process is complex. As a user, that can be irritating because you just want to get to the good stuff. Quick.\\n\\nDeep app linking eliminates these unnecessary steps, takes you to the app’s core functionalities, and lets users explore the app with practically zero friction! But that’s not the only benefit of having a deep link mobile app.\\n\\nDeep links can be used as leverage to promote the app through various channels like social media, websites, or even search engine results. In easy words, it makes your mobile app a whole lot more discoverable.\\n\\nIf you google [Taylor Swift](https://www.google.com/search?q=taylor+swift&oq=taylor+swift&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg7MgYIAhBFGDsyBwgDEAAYjwIyBwgEEAAYjwIyBggFEEUYPDIGCAYQRRg90gEIMTMwM2owajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), the top 5 results will be her official Twitter account, Instagram account, and YouTube channel. And all of them will redirect you to the app instead of a browser view.\\n\\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XjwvIyArOgHPQZptBX50MOWedDFDc1vKF0wOjpLvPs3YyPjJGXc4zP8PrbxR9w7pjIYLqf6n8zzaunFlxEGFBU97ypex554VsaimrvCH1B51dMuNNbC17kt_pjYCjWRgaOD74amMTdNKLw_EiJEPrF4)_And that’s how these multi-billion dollar companies benefit from app deep links!_\\n\\n### Re-engages users that were previously inactive\\n\\nLet’s be honest for a second here. You and I both have that one app on our phones that we don’t use every day but we also haven’t uninstalled it either. For me, that’d be Pinterest– and our mobile deep link example for now.\\n\\n![SfydjsB1wdPiO9v RWtlsFFLc0u7q5bKShO9OYc2aICl3nTdjkCqfNNaEjvmM61mp5qfujth W1CFrOXvrqeahGabIOc66PuWniUTFcVvHTk7EYlQdodPhfl2weFt](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SfydjsB1wdPiO9v-RWtlsFFLc0u7q5bKShO9OYc2aICl3nTdjkCqfNNaEjvmM61mp5qfujth_W1CFrOXvrqeahGabIOc66PuWniUTFcVvHTk7EYlQdodPhfl2weFt-doPVPuuB1xY1VeTi4vEm3m1TQ)\\n\\nEven though it’s a popular app, I just sometimes forget that I still have it. So how does [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) re-engage me to become an active user again? It sends me a push notification of the following sorts:\\n\\n- _Check out these 10 boards like yours Laiba!_\\n- _Laiba, these ideas are so you ❤️_\\n- _Laiba, you have a good eye ?_\\n- _Travel Essentials for Laiba_\\n- _“Kitten pictures” and more…_\\n\\nYou get my point, right? And it’s a genius way to get an inactive and forgetful user to get back to your app and spend some time there. Without a mobile app deep link, there’s not a lot you can do to get those inactive users back.\\n\\n### Strengthens your marketing strategy\\n\\nMobile app deep linking strengthens your marketing strategy by providing targeted and personalized experiences to users. By leveraging deep links in your campaigns, you can guide users to specific content related to the campaign, increasing its effectiveness.\\n\\nFor example, in a promotional email for a flash sale, a deep link can direct users to the exact product page within the app, eliminating the need for users to search or navigate. This seamless mobile deep linking not only improves conversion rates but also enhances user satisfaction, leading to a stronger marketing impact and higher ROI.\\n\\nCheck out an example from [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/), right out of my inbox!\\n\\n![E4tHiqdL92 2W6EmQCm WiJN4FmWXiAzJJ1Ihm09X7 mNpCpyVHLB6mDgfl LHKwiSjj2WwyBNavtYSfd23ghdZs8q4m8uxy7dCTQLRx iPddqOnhrOBCzvPDuaopkim0BiXzJgKVbdkJJWcCX0JI g](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/E4tHiqdL92-2W6EmQCm-WiJN4FmWXiAzJJ1Ihm09X7_mNpCpyVHLB6mDgfl-LHKwiSjj2WwyBNavtYSfd23ghdZs8q4m8uxy7dCTQLRx-iPddqOnhrOBCzvPDuaopkim0BiXzJgKVbdkJJWcCX0JI-g)\\n\\nSo the next time you wonder what is a deep link to an app, the answer would be “key to a golden success.”\\n\\n## The role of mobile app deep linking in user experience\\n\\nThe real reason mobile app deep linking is considered so important and employed by every single successful app out there is because of the impact it makes on the user experience. No matter what your ultimate goal is, no developer wants to achieve it at the expense of the user experience.\\n\\nHere are 3 ways app deep links impact the user experience:\\n\\n### Personalizes app navigation\\n\\nDeep linking significantly improves the user experience by offering personalized app navigation. By leveraging deep links, users can directly access specific screens, features, or content within the app that align with their interests or needs.\\n\\nThis eliminates the need for users to manually navigate through multiple screens, reducing friction and enhancing convenience. Personalized app navigation saves time and effort, providing users with a seamless and tailored experience that caters to their individual preferences.\\n\\nFor example, Google News utilizes deep links to direct users to personalized news categories based on their previous reading preferences. Users would no longer need to search or browse through different sections to find content that interests them, resulting in a more satisfying and efficient user experience.\\n\\n![123](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/123-980x1024.png)\\n\\n### Uninterrupted transitions\\n\\nEveryone loves to have a smooth experience, whether that’s about checking into a hotel room or going through your everyday apps. Deep linking makes that possible and enables seamless transitions between apps and websites, further enhancing the user experience.\\n\\nWith universal deep links, users can seamlessly switch between web and app experiences without interruption. If a user clicks on a deep link that corresponds to a specific page or content within an app but does not have the app installed, they are automatically redirected to the relevant web page.\\n\\n### Simplifies the process\\n\\nDeep linking facilitates the faster accomplishment of user goals within an app. By directing users to specific screens or features, deep links streamline the user journey and reduce the number of steps required to accomplish tasks. This optimized navigation helps users achieve their goals more efficiently, saving time and enhancing the overall user experience.\\n\\n## Current trends in mobile app deep linking in 2025\\n\\nMobile app deep links have come a long way with how technology is shaping up the world in 2025. Here are 2 ways you can tell the current trends of mobile app deep linking in 2025:\\n\\n### Voice-activated deep linking\\n\\nVoice assistants and smart speakers have become more prevalent, and voice-activated deep linking has emerged as a trend in 2025. Users can now interact with voice assistants to perform tasks that involve deep links, such as launching specific app features or navigating to relevant in-app content.\\n\\nA retail app like Amazon incorporates voice-activated deep linking with voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Users can say commands like “Hey Alexa, order the product I added to my wishlist in the retail app” to trigger a deep link that navigates them directly to the product checkout page within the app.\\n\\n### Augmented reality (AR) deep linking\\n\\nWith the increasing popularity of augmented reality, deep linking has extended its reach into the AR space. AR deep linking enables users to launch specific AR experiences within apps directly from deep links.\\n\\nThis trend has opened up new possibilities for interactive and immersive experiences, such as AR-powered product demos, virtual try-ons, and location-based AR experiences.\\n\\nThe best examples of this are in real estate apps where you can get a 3D virtual tour of an apartment without having to visit the location. The same goes for many tour-related apps which can show you a dream destination right from your phone!\\n\\n## How to implement deep linking in your mobile app?\\n\\n![freestocks 40k6ZqbsXuo unsplash2 jpg](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/freestocks-40k6ZqbsXuo-unsplash2-jpg.webp)\\n\\nDeep linking is a powerful tool that enhances user experience and drives engagement within a mobile app. Implementing deep linking requires careful planning and integration. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to deep link to an app:\\n\\n1. **Design the deep link structure**\\n\\nDefine the structure and purpose of your deep links. Determine the specific screens or content within your app that you want to link to. Plan how you want to use deep links for different user interactions, such as navigating to a specific product, accessing personalized content, or initiating a specific action within the app.\\n\\n2. **Set up URI scheme or app links**\\n\\nFor deep linking to work, you need to establish the link association between your app and its respective URI scheme (for iOS) or App Links (for Android). This involves defining the custom URI scheme or configuring the App Links metadata in your app’s configuration files. Ensure you follow the platform-specific guidelines and use the appropriate programming language.\\n\\n3. **Handle deep links in the app**\\n\\nImplement the necessary code in your app to handle incoming deep links. Upon receiving a deep link, the app should be able to parse the link’s parameters, extract relevant information, and navigate the user to the appropriate screen or perform the intended action.\\n\\n4. **Generate deep links**\\n\\nTo generate deep links dynamically, use a tool or library that supports deep link generation based on user-specific data or contextual information. This allows you to create personalized deep links for campaigns, user onboarding, or targeted content.\\n\\n5. **Handle deferred deep links**\\n\\nIf you want to support deferred deep linking, implement logic that captures the initial intent from the deep link after the app is installed. This ensures a seamless experience for users who clicked on deep links before having the app installed.\\n\\n6. **Test deep links**\\n\\nThoroughly test your deep links across different scenarios to ensure their accuracy and functionality. Test deep links from external sources, such as emails, websites, or social media, to ensure they correctly navigate users to the intended screens or actions within the app.\\n\\n7. **Integrate analytics and measurement**\\n\\nIncorporate analytics tools or [deep link attribution platforms](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/mobile-campaign-deep-link) to track and measure the [success of your app performance](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-measure-app-performance/) and deep links. This enables you to analyze user behavior, monitor conversion rates, and optimize your deep linking strategy for better results!\\n\\n## Challenges and solutions in mobile app deep linking\\n\\nApp deep links are a complex concept, meaning you’ll encounter many challenges that hold you back. But what good would this blog be if I didn’t tackle a few of those along the way:\\n\\n### Handling different types of links\\n\\nYour apps need to be able to handle different types of deep links. We already talked about how there are 3 types of deep links and understanding the best ones for your app takes some time. Here is how you can do better at handling different mobile app deep link types!\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n- Identify the types of deep links your app needs to support (e.g., standard, contextual, deferred).\\n- Implement link-handling logic in your app, including parsing and interpreting deep link parameters.\\n- Utilize deep linking libraries or frameworks that offer support for handling different link types.\\n- Test your app with various deep link scenarios to ensure accurate handling and behavior.\\n\\n### Managing link behavior across different platforms\\n\\nDifferent platforms (such as iOS and Android) have their own specifications for deep linking. When you come across different terms and their implementations, it might become a doomed spiral of confusion.\\n\\nURI schemes, app links, verifications, and configurations… you get the gist.\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n- Familiarize yourself with the platform-specific guidelines and documentation for deep linking (e.g., iOS URL schemes, Android App Links).\\n- Implement platform-specific code to handle deep links according to each platform’s specifications.\\n- Test deep link behavior on different platforms and devices to ensure consistency and proper functionality.\\n\\n### App installation and deferred deep linking\\n\\nApp installation and deferred deep linking pose challenges because they require seamless transitions from external sources to the app after installation. Meeting user expectations, accurately tracking installations from deep links, and ensuring the proper handling of deferred deep links during the app’s first launch are critical.\\n\\nPlus, App Store limitations and the complexity of testing and debugging deep linking scenarios can be chaotic for many app developers!\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n- Integrate an SDK or deep linking service that supports deferred deep linking (e.g., [Branch](https://adapty.io/integrations/branch/), Firebase Dynamic Links).\\n- Implement code to capture and handle deferred deep links upon app launch.\\n- Store the deferred deep link data securely and process it to navigate users to the intended content.\\n- Test deferred deep linking by simulating scenarios where users click on deep links before app installation and ensure a seamless transition upon app launch.\\n\\n### Security and privacy breaches\\n\\nSecurity and privacy breaches can be caused by a simple slip-up when we’re talking about mobile app deep links. In deep linking, you are passing data through URLs or link parameters which can potentially expose sensitive information to the wrong parties.\\n\\nUser privacy is something that brought the likes of Google and Facebook (now Meta) to their knees and is one of the most valuable assets for any app. Here are some ways to protect your mobile app from any such breaches:\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n- Avoid including sensitive information directly in deep link URLs.\\n- Implement proper encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure data transmitted through deep links.\\n- Validate and sanitize input parameters to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).\\n- Follow security and privacy best practices, such as encrypting deep link data, using HTTPS, and adhering to data protection regulations.\\n\\n### Error handling and fallback strategies\\n\\nIn cases where deep links fail to navigate users to the desired location, fallback strategies come to place. Of course, error handling and [fallback strategies](https://adapty.io/fallback-paywalls/) are a whole new game when we’re talking about deep-linking apps!\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n- Implement error-handling logic to handle scenarios where deep links fail or encounter errors.\\n- Display informative error messages to users, guiding them on how to proceed or providing alternative options.\\n- Establish fallback strategies, such as offering alternative paths or suggesting relevant content if a deep link fails.\\n- Monitor and analyze deep link-related errors to identify potential issues and continuously improve error-handling mechanisms.\\n\\n## Impact of mobile app deep linking on marketing\\n\\n![solen feyissa UWVJaDvXW c unsplash2 jpg](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/solen-feyissa-UWVJaDvXW_c-unsplash2-jpg.webp)\\n\\nDeep linking plays a significant role in app marketing by providing targeted user experiences, increasing app visibility, and improving conversion rates. After all, there’s a reason why we’ve diving this deep into the concept!\\n\\nLet’s explore how deep links can be utilized in all the different aspects of marketing, starting with…\\n\\n1. **Marketing campaigns**\\n\\nDeep links can be integrated into marketing campaigns to provide a personalized and seamless user experience. By directing users to specific screens or content related to the campaign, deep links increase the effectiveness of marketing efforts and drive higher conversion rates.\\n\\nFor example, a deep link in a social media ad can take users directly to a product page within the app, simplifying the user journey and improving the chances of a purchase.\\n\\n2. **In-app ads**\\n\\nDeep links can be used within in-app ads to guide users to relevant content or specific actions within the app. By deep-linking the ad creative to relevant sections of the app, advertisers can drive engagement and encourage users to interact with the app immediately. This enhances the effectiveness of in-app advertising and improves user acquisition and retention rates.\\n\\n3. **Email marketing**\\n\\nDeep links can be included in email marketing campaigns to drive app downloads, encourage user engagement, and promote specific features or offers.\\n\\nBy incorporating deep links in email content, such as promotional banners or call-to-action buttons, users can be directed to relevant app screens, personalized content, or exclusive deals. This streamlined experience increases user engagement and conversion rates.\\n\\n4. **Social media**\\n\\nDeep links can be shared on social media platforms to drive traffic and encourage app installations.\\n\\nBy providing direct access to specific content or offers, deep links facilitate a seamless transition from social media to the app, reducing friction and increasing conversion rates. Plus, utilizing deep linking in social media campaigns allows for more precise tracking and measurement of campaign performance.\\n\\n## Impact of mobile app deep linking on SEO and app visibility\\n\\nDeep linking impacts SEO by improving app visibility in search engine results. When deep links are indexed by search engines, they enable users to access specific app content directly from search results.\\n\\nThis way, you’ve enhanced the app’s visibility, increased organic user acquisition, and driven more targeted traffic to the app. Deep linking also helps search engines understand the relevance and context of app content, improving its ranking in search results.\\n\\nSounds like a win-win, right? That’s because it is!\\n\\nFurthermore, deep links shared on external websites or social media platforms can drive referral traffic, indicating popularity and relevance to search engines. This can positively impact the app’s SEO by indicating its importance and authority.\\n\\n## Future perspectives: where is mobile app deep linking headed?\\n\\nThere are a lot of technological accelerations happening in a magnitude of directions.

Short forms, quick skips, early paywall. Though they might see more people getting through onboarding, this doesn’t convert into long-term value – not for users, and not for the app.\\n\\nPeople do not download your app to “explore features.” They want to get a job done. And more often than not, the job is not functional but emotional. When onboarding helps them see that your product is the right tool for that job, you don’t get simple conversions but higher retention and LTV.\\n\\nIn this article, I’ll explain how to leverage the **Jobs-to-be-Done framework** during user onboarding to accelerate or rekindle your app’s growth. You’ll also find real examples of app onboarding flows that utilize this approach.\\n\\n## How to convince people that your app is the right choice\\n\\nMost apps promise a functional job: “track workouts,” “block distractions,” “crunch macros.” But users don’t want to do something for the sake of doing it. They want to see a positive change in their lives.\\n\\nThat’s why it’s more important to keep focus not only on a functional job your app promises to deliver, but on an emotional or socially driven job.\\n\\n— User doesn’t want to build muscles → they want to feel more confident.\\n\\n— User doesn’t want to have VPN → they want to have a good time watching shows not available in their region.\\n\\nBut here’s the catch. You can’t make users experience the outcome of completing a job because they just downloaded the app. Moreover, they are subject to **anxiety** and **inertia** that keep them from trying something new.\\n\\nSo you need to help users understand the value of your app before they experience it. That’s where the Jobs-to-be-Done onboarding comes in, allowing you to build **perceived value**.\\n\\nJobs-to-be-Done onboarding helps accomplish three objectives:\\n\\n- **Build perceived value** by demonstrating you understand their deeper motivations\\n- **Reduce anxiety** by addressing concerns before they become conversion blockers\\n- **Establish trust** through social proof from users with similar goals\\n\\n> **What is Job-to-be-Done?**\\n>\\n> Job-to-be-Done is a framework that focuses on understanding why people “hire” products to solve problems in their lives. Instead of asking what features users want, it asks what job they’re trying to accomplish.\\n>\\n> The core insight: people don’t buy products for the products themselves – they buy them to make progress toward a goal or resolve a struggle.\\n>\\n> A person doesn’t buy a drill because they want a drill; they buy it because they need a hole in the wall. In apps, this means looking beyond functional tasks (“track workouts”) to understand the emotional outcomes users actually want (“feel more confident,” “sleep better,” “reduce anxiety”).\\n\\n## Why are longer onboarding flows ≠ worse results\\n\\nThe goal of creating perceived value, reducing anxiety, and establishing trust transforms into onboarding that signals to the user, “Hey, I know how you feel. Here’s how I can help, and here’s what others have already achieved through this app”.\\n\\nBut that means that you’ll need to add more screens to your flow, which sounds counterintuitive. Won’t people drop off? This concern arises from our misunderstanding of friction.\\n\\nThere are two types of friction: negative and positive.\\n\\n- **Negative friction** serves the company, not the user. Registration forms, marketing permissions, tracking requests, “Where did you hear about us?” These screens extract value without giving any back.\\n- **Positive friction** serves the user. It personalizes the experience, demonstrates understanding, and builds confidence that this is the right product for their specific needs.\\n\\nIn practice, you can add multiple screens as long as they provide value to the user. The more positive friction you add while reducing negative friction, the higher your conversion rates climb.\\n\\n## What are the results of implementing Jobs-to-be-Done onboarding\\n\\nThanks to Jobs-to-be-Done onboarding, you get more motivated users who are more likely to make a purchase and stay longer within your app.\\n\\nResults of applying the Jobs-to-be-Done onboarding are consistent, and I saw it over and over again with partner apps. One subscription app achieved a 72% conversion increase, another saw 300% higher average revenue per user, and a third improved conversions to payer by 35%.\\n\\n## When and how to start implementing JTBD onboarding\\n\\nIt might seem like you need to have a large app to start investing effort into JTBD onboarding flows, but in reality, you can start as early as possible. You need a product and some conversion event (downloads, trials, or purchases), but you don’t need significant revenue or large user bases.\\n\\nSo, the path to building JTBD onboarding flows is straightforward: talk to your users.\\n\\nIdentify **recent converters**, send personal outreach messages, and schedule 15-20 minute conversations focused on their decision psychology rather than product feedback.\\n\\n**Who:** Recent converters (within 7-14 days of purchase/trial). They remember their decision-making but haven’t developed strong product opinions yet.\\n\\n**How many:** Around 10 users.\\n\\n**Recruitment:** Personal outreach: “Do you have 15-20 minutes to talk about the product so we can make it better?” Phone calls often work better than scheduled meetings.\\n\\n**Questions focus on decision psychology, not product features:**\\n\\n- “What did you think the product was going to enable you to do?”\\n- “Can you remember when you downloaded the app? What were you thinking?”\\n- “How long have you been thinking about this problem?”\\n\\nAvoid product-focused questions like “What features do you like?” or “How would you rate the interface?” If you’re asking about your product, you’re asking wrong questions.\\n\\nAnd here is a simple template for arranging a call.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**_Subject: Quick chat about \\\\[Product Name\\\\]?_**\\n\\n_Hi \\\\[Name\\\\],_\\n\\n_I noticed you recently started using \\\\[Product Name\\\\] – thank you!_\\n\\n_I’m \\\\[Your Name\\\\] from the \\\\[Product Name\\\\] team. Do you have 15-20 minutes this week to share why you decided to try our app? Your insights help us make the product better for users like you._\\n\\n_Feel free to grab a time that works: \\\\[calendar link\\\\]_\\n\\n_Or just reply to this email and we can set something up._\\n\\n_Thanks,_\\n\\n_\\\\[Your Name\\\\]_\\n\\n_\\\\[Your Title\\\\]_\\n\\n_\\\\[Direct email/phone\\\\]_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAfter 10 interviews, you’ll have clear themes around emotional jobs and typical anxieties. Use these insights to **create one or two onboarding screens** that address the strongest patterns you discovered.\\n\\n## What interview mistakes to avoid\\n\\n**Mistake 1:** Using customer success or usability testing interviews instead of Job-to-be-Done methodology. These provide different insights but won’t reveal purchase motivations.\\n\\n**Mistake 2:** Interviewing long-term users instead of recent converters. Established users have developed product opinions that overshadow their original decision drivers.\\n\\n**Mistake 3:** Asking leading questions or focusing on features. This pushes users toward answers you want to hear rather than revealing their true motivations.\\n\\n**Mistake 4:** Having your research team conduct interviews while you review transcripts later. The value comes from firsthand exposure to user psychology. You need to be present, listening to their struggles and motivations directly.\\n\\n**Mistake 5:** Running interviews through AI for analysis. While AI can help organize information, the effort of manually analyzing transcripts – the pain of doing the work yourself increases your empathy towards your users and generates better insights and stronger conviction about what to build.\\n\\n## How to transform insights into onboarding screens\\n\\nOnce you’ve completed interviews, you’ll identify themes around emotional jobs and anxieties. A fitness app might discover themes like “build confidence,” “sleep better,” “reduce anxiety,” or “feel better in my skin.” Under each theme, you’ll find specific anxieties: “Is this too hard for me?” “Do I have the right equipment?” “Will people judge me at the gym?”\\n\\nUse these insights to create onboarding screens that address jobs and reduce anxieties:\\n\\n**Question screens** highlighting emotional jobs, not functional tasks.\\n\\n![Praktika](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/Praktika-501x1024.webp)**Praktika**\\n\\n**Personalization screens:** Ask users about their current state to tailor the product to them.\\n\\n![IMG 1660](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1660-473x1024.webp)**BetterMe**![IMG 1663](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1663-473x1024.webp)**BetterMe**\\n\\n**Comparison screens:** Likely, the user has already tried other ways to reach their goal, hasn’t succeeded, and is feeling anxious about it. Acknowledge the possible anxiety and show how your app can do a better job.\\n\\n![IMG 1786](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1786-501x1024.webp)**Intermittent Fasting Tracker**![IMG 1787](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1787-501x1024.webp)**Intermittent Fasting Tracker**\\n\\n**Statement screens:** Direct quotes from interviews presented as statements users can agree with.\\n\\n![IMG 1682](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1682-473x1024.webp)**Me+**![IMG 1685](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1685-473x1024.webp)**Headway**\\n\\n**Social proof screens:** Reviews and testimonials specifically focused on the emotional jobs your app helps users achieve, not generic product praise.\\n\\n![IMG 1677](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1677-473x1024.webp)**Me+**\\n\\n**Commitment screens:** Pledges or contracts where users commit to their goal.\\n\\n![IMG 1676](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1676-473x1024.webp)**Praktika**![IMG 1687](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1687-473x1024.webp)**Headway**\\n\\n**Tangible results screen**:Show users what they can achieve with your app.\\n\\n![IMG 1692](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1692-473x1024.webp)**Opal**\\n\\nRemember: these screens focus entirely on user psychology – how they feel, what they want to achieve. Your product is merely the means to their end. Avoid featuring functionality or technical capabilities.\\n\\n## How to measure impact of app onboarding improvements\\n\\nFirst, track **conversion rate to paid subscription** as your primary metric. This directly measures onboarding effectiveness.\\n\\nIf you have enough traffic, I would strongly suggest A/B testing those changes to ensure that the impact is significant and that you’re not seeing a trade-off, such as increasing your trial start rate while simultaneously reducing ARPU.\\n\\nSecondary metrics include **early engagement rates** and **day-1 through day-7 retention**. If your Jobs-to-be-Done onboarding truly connects with users, they should demonstrate higher initial engagement with your product.\\n\\nBe cautious with longer-term retention metrics, as other factors (product updates, acquisition channels, seasonal changes) can influence these numbers. Focus on conversion and early engagement for the clearest signal.\\n\\nWhile conversion improvements are immediate and measurable, Jobs-to-be-Done onboarding creates broader benefits:\\n\\n**Higher engagement:** Users who understand how your app fits their life goals engage more consistently.\\n\\n**Better retention:** When users see clear connection between app usage and personal objectives, they stick around longer.\\n\\n**Reduced churn:** Users with strong perceived value are less likely to cancel when facing minor product issues.\\n\\n**Improved product decisions:** Understanding real user jobs guides feature development toward capabilities that matter most.\\n\\nIf you’re new to adding positive friction in your onboarding, start small. Introduce a social proof screen, a goal-setting screen, keep things simple, and iterate as you build the full flow.\\n\\nBut remember: garbage in, garbage out. Spend time nailing your user interviews before diving into new screen designs.\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### Should I make onboarding shorter or longer?\\n\\nNeither. Make it useful. Cut steps that serve you. Keep steps that help users see outcomes and feel confident.\\n\\n### How many screens is too many?\\n\\nAs many as you need to add value. If a screen personalizes, reduces anxiety, or proves results, it earns its place.\\n\\n### What should I show before the paywall?\\n\\nOutcome first. Show the job users care about, personalize the plan, add proof from similar users, then show price.\\n\\n### Why do people drop off even with a quick start?\\n\\nThey do not see the outcome. Speed without perceived value feels risky, so they bounce.\\n\\n### What is positive friction and how do I add it?\\n\\nHelpful steps that serve the user. Use goal selection, simple personalization, clear expectations, and outcome-based proof.\\n\\n### Will this work for small apps?\\n\\nYes. You only need a product and a conversion event. Start with a couple of value-adding screens and iterate.\\n\\n### How do I find what users really want?\\n\\nTalk to recent converters within 7 to 14 days. About ten short interviews usually reveal emotional jobs and common anxieties.\\n\\n### What should I ask during user interviews?\\n\\nAsk about the decision, not features. Examples: what outcome they hoped for, what was happening when they downloaded, how long the problem has existed.\\n\\n### What screens reliably lift conversion?\\n\\nGoal selection focused on outcomes, simple personalization, comparison to alternatives, outcome-based social proof, a goal commitment, and a results preview.\\n\\n### How do I reduce user’s anxiety in onboarding?\\n\\nName the fear and answer it early. Explain effort, tools, and timeline. Show examples from users like them.\\n\\n### Do I need social proof for onboarding?\\n\\nYes. Use proof tied to outcomes. “I feel more confident” beats “Great design.” Match proof to the user’s chosen goal.\\n\\n### What metrics should I track to measure results?\\n\\nConversion to paid is primary. Then early engagement and day 1 to day 7 retention. A/B test each change if you can.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

With Stripe charging just 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, many developers wonder if this could be a viable alternative.\\n\\nBut can you actually use Stripe for in-app purchases without violating platform policies? [The April 2025 ruling in the Epic Games v. Apple case](https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control) has fundamentally changed what’s possible, making this question more relevant than ever.\\n\\n## App Store payment policies: then and now\\n\\n### Traditional rules\\n\\nThe app payment ecosystem has historically been tightly controlled:\\n\\n- Apple’s App Store requires using StoreKit for digital goods.\\n- Google Play mandates its Billing Library for similar purchases.\\n- Both take 15-30% of each transaction.\\n- Alternative payment methods were mostly prohibited.\\n\\nFor years, the rule was clear: if you’re selling digital content used within your app, you had to use the platform’s native payment system. Stripe for in-app purchases was generally restricted to physical goods or real-world services.\\n\\n### The 2025 turning point\\n\\nThe Epic Games v. Apple case brought a profound shift to this landscape. The court ruled that Apple could no longer prevent apps from including links to external payment systems for digital purchases. This opened new possibilities for Stripe for in-app purchases, at least in the United States.\\n\\nNow, developers can include buttons or links directing users to web-based payment options without paying Apple’s commission fees. This creates meaningful opportunities for integrating Stripe for in-app purchases into iOS apps.\\n\\n→ Read more on **[New U.S. ruling on external iOS payments](https://adapty.io/blog/new-us-ruling-on-external-ios-payments/)**\\n\\n## When can you use Stripe for in-app purchases?\\n\\nThe answer depends on several factors: the platform, your app category, and the specific use case. Let’s break it down:\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Physical goods and real-world services\\n\\n**Yes, you can use Stripe for in-app purchases**.\\n\\nIf your app sells physical products (clothing, electronics, books) or real-world services (rides, cleaning services, food delivery), you’re free to use Stripe or any other payment processor. These transactions have always been exempt from the App Store’s payment requirements.\\n\\nTake food delivery apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats. They use external payment processors without issue, since they’re delivering physical goods.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Digital content for external use\\n\\n**Yes, with some conditions.**\\n\\nGoogle Play allows you to use Stripe for in-app purchases if you’re selling digital goods meant to be used outside of your app. For example, if you’re selling a subscription to a magazine, you could use Stripe to process these in-app purchases.\\n\\nConsider whether users will primarily consume your content outside your app. If yes, Stripe may be an option worth exploring.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Cross-platform subscriptions (the web + app model)\\n\\n**Yes, but with strategic implementation.**\\n\\nIn many cases, developers sell subscriptions both in-app and on the web. You can use Stripe for in-app purchases to process payments on the web and then unlock access to the subscription or digital product on every device where the user is logged in.\\n\\nThis approach requires users to leave your app and make the purchase via a web browser, but the recent ruling makes this flow much more seamless.\\n\\n### 4\\\\. U.S. apps after April 2025\\n\\n**Yes, with proper implementation.**\\n\\nFollowing the April 2025 court decision, Stripe has shared documentation that shows iOS developers how to avoid the Apple commission by accepting payments using Stripe for in-app purchases outside of their apps.\\n\\nApps on the U.S. App Store can now include a button or link to their own website’s checkout page, and Apple can’t take a cut.\\n\\n_The key question to consider_: Are you willing to build and maintain your own payment infrastructure to save on platform fees? For many developers facing significant commission costs, this trade-off makes financial sense.\\n\\n## Implementing external payment options\\n\\nMany developers are now integrating Stripe through a three-part strategy:\\n\\n### Technical implementation\\n\\nBelow is a basic SwiftUI view that demonstrates the flow for creating a personalized checkout experience on the web. This example is a starting point and does not include comprehensive error handling or UX refinements, so you’ll need to adapt it for your specific use case.\\n\\n```\\nSwift\\n\\nimport Foundation\\nimport SwiftUI\\nimport StoreKit\\n\\nstruct SubscribeView: View {\\n  @State var serverMgr: ServerManager = ServerManager()\\n  @State var paymentComplete = false\\n  @State var checkoutURL: URL? = nil\\n\\n  var body: some View {\\n    content\\n      .task {\\n        do {\\n          checkoutURL = try await serverMgr.createCheckoutURL()\\n        } catch {\\n          // Handle error more gracefully\\n          print(error)\\n        }\\n      }\\n      .onOpenURL { url in\\n        // Handle the universal link from Checkout.\\n        if url.absoluteString.contains(\\\"success\\\") {\\n          // The payment was completed.\\n          // Show a success page and fetch the latest\\n          // customer entitlements from your server.\\n          paymentComplete = true\\n        }\\n      }\\n  }\\n\\n  @ViewBuilder\\n  var content: some View {\\n    // Check if payments are blocked by Parental Controls or MDM on this device.\\n    if !AppStore.canMakePayments {\\n      Text(\\\"Payments are disabled on this device.\\\")\\n    } else {\\n      if paymentComplete {\\n        Text(\\\"Payment complete!\\\")\\n      } else {\\n        Button {\\n          if let checkoutURL {\\n            UIApplication.shared.open(checkoutURL, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)\\n          }\\n        } label: {\\n          Text(\\\"Subscribe Now\\\")\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\nSwift\\n\\nimport Foundation\\nimport SwiftUI\\nimport StoreKit\\n\\nstruct SubscribeView: View {\\n  @State var serverMgr: ServerManager = ServerManager()\\n  @State var paymentComplete = false\\n  @State var checkoutURL: URL? = nil\\n\\n  var body: some View {\\n    content\\n      .task {\\n        do {\\n          checkoutURL = try await serverMgr.createCheckoutURL()\\n        } catch {\\n          // Handle error more gracefully\\n          print(error)\\n        }\\n      }\\n      .onOpenURL { url in\\n        // Handle the universal link from Checkout.\\n        if url.absoluteString.contains(\\\"success\\\") {\\n          // The payment was completed.\\n          // Show a success page and fetch the latest\\n          // customer entitlements from your server.\\n          paymentComplete = true\\n        }\\n      }\\n  }\\n\\n  @ViewBuilder\\n  var content: some View {\\n    // Check if payments are blocked by Parental Controls or MDM on this device.\\n    if !AppStore.canMakePayments {\\n      Text(\\\"Payments are disabled on this device.\\\")\\n    } else {\\n      if paymentComplete {\\n        Text(\\\"Payment complete!\\\")\\n      } else {\\n        Button {\\n          if let checkoutURL {\\n            UIApplication.shared.open(checkoutURL, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)\\n          }\\n        } label: {\\n          Text(\\\"Subscribe Now\\\")\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo facilitate the individualized URL you need to present the external checkout, you’ll need to do two things:\\n\\n1. Provide an endpoint on your server to log the user in and get a session token.\\n2. Use that session token with another server endpoint to get an individualized checkout URL.\\n\\nThe Swift code below enables your app to interact with the necessary endpoints, providing the data required to make the SwiftUI view work. You’ll need to implement the server-side logic on your own backend. Stripe offers [detailed guides](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/digital-goods/checkout?lang=ruby) for this, including language-specific examples. The code here has been adapted from their documentation and updated for Swift Concurrency.\\n\\n```\\nSwift\\n\\n@Observable\\nfinal class ServerManager {\\nenum ServerError: Error {\\ncase invalidLoginURL\\ncase invalidCheckoutURL\\n}\\n\\nstruct LoginResponse: Decodable {\\nlet token: String\\n}\\n\\nstruct CheckoutResponse: Decodable {\\nlet url: URL\\n}\\n\\n// The cached login token\\nvar token: String?\\n\\n/// Run this first to log into your server to correlate this mobile user\\n/// with their web profile.

You can offer lower prices on the web to encourage users to switch to external payment methods or set premium prices in-app for the most loyal customers.\\n\\n![Side-by-side comparison of YouTube Premium pricing showing a lower $7.99/month rate on web versus $9.49/month in-app, encouraging users to choose the cheaper option.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/youtube-premium-price-comparison.png-1024x1024.webp)\\n\\n_YouTube Premium offers different rates for web and in-app purchases, highlighting the potential for better margins and experimentation._\\n\\nThis flexibility allows you to optimize ARPU and test pricing hypotheses without platform restrictions.\\n\\n### User experience considerations\\n\\nThe critical challenge is smoothing the transition between your app and the external payment flow. What you can do:\\n\\n- Create a seamless visual transition to the browser.\\n- Implement Universal Links to bring users back automatically.\\n- Test multiple approaches to find what converts best for their specific users.\\n\\n_One important tip_: Save the user’s selection state so that when they return from the web payment, they can pick up right where they left off.\\n\\n## Benefits of using Stripe for in-app purchases\\n\\nWhen allowed by platform rules, Stripe offers several advantages:\\n\\n1. **Lower fees.** Stripe’s transaction fees are 2.9% + $0.30 per credit card charge versus Apple and Google’s 15% or 30% cut of revenue. For a $10 monthly subscription, that’s approximately $0.59 with Stripe versus $1.50-$3.00 with platform fees.\\n2. **Greater flexibility.** Using Stripe allows you to manage pricing, subscriptions, and the user experience in ways that Apple and Google’s frameworks don’t support. You can set up features like dynamic pricing, adjusting prices depending on the user’s history or what else is in their cart.\\n3. **Better analytics.** Stripe gives you deeper access to payment analytics than Apple and Google provide. Through Stripe, you can view more data about payments and your users.\\n4. **Faster payouts.** Unlike Apple’s 30-60 day payout cycle, web processors like Stripe and Paddle typically pay out within days. This means faster cash flow and a shorter payback window for paid acquisition.\\n\\n## Potential risks and considerations\\n\\nBefore implementing Stripe for in-app purchases, consider these factors:\\n\\n### Regional restrictions\\n\\nThe April 2025 ruling in the Epic v. Apple case specifically applies to the United States App Store only. This means:\\n\\n- Apps distributed through the US App Store can include links to external payment systems.\\n- Apps in other countries’ App Stores may still be prohibited from linking to external payment options.\\n- Developers with global audiences need different implementation strategies for different regions.\\n- The same app might need different versions depending on the user’s location.\\n\\nConsider creating region-specific builds or implementing dynamic payment options based on the user’s location.\\n\\n### Implementation complexity\\n\\nUsing Stripe instead of Apple’s in-app purchases introduces several technical complexities:\\n\\n**Server-side development requirements**\\n\\n- You must set up and maintain your own server to create Stripe checkout sessions.\\n- Your server needs to process webhooks from Stripe to confirm successful payments.\\n- Purchase verification systems must be built to validate user entitlements.\\n\\n**Cross-platform account management**\\n\\n- User accounts must be maintained across your app and website.\\n- Purchase history and subscription status need to sync across platforms.\\n- Password reset and account recovery flows become your responsibility.\\n\\n**Security considerations**\\n\\n- Payment data security becomes your responsibility.\\n- Server infrastructure requires proper security hardening.\\n- Compliance with payment card industry (PCI) standards.\\n\\nConsider whether you have the technical resources to implement and maintain this infrastructure. If not, integration platforms can handle much of this complexity.\\n\\n### User experience challenges\\n\\nImplementing external payment options introduces significant user experience challenges:\\n\\n**Conversion impact of app exits**\\n\\n- Users must leave your app to complete payment.\\n- Each additional step typically reduces conversion rates by 20-30%.\\n- Some users may abandon the purchase when redirected outside the app.\\n\\n**User expectations and friction points**\\n\\n- Regular app users expect the simplicity of native payments.\\n- External payment flows create cognitive load for users.\\n- Different payment UIs can cause confusion and uncertainty.\\n\\n**Optimization strategies**\\n\\n- A/B testing different presentations of payment options is essential.\\n- Clear explanations of the price difference can improve external payment adoption.\\n- Universal Links provide crucial return paths to your app post-payment.\\n- Saving cart/selection state is necessary for users who abandon the external flow.\\n\\n## Simplifying integration with Adapty\\n\\nFor developers seeking to streamline Stripe integration, third-party tools can significantly reduce implementation complexity.\\n\\nAdapty, available in the [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/adapty), offers a simplified integration process:\\n\\n1. Install the Adapty app to your Stripe account.\\n2. Copy your Stripe API keys.\\n3. Paste them into Adapty.\\n4. Skip manual webhook configuration as it’s handled automatically.\\n\\n![Adapty integration with Stripe for in-app purchases, showing a web-to-app subscription flow where users pay on the web and access premium content in the app.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stripe-app-marketplace-adapty-1024x541.webp)\\n\\nThis approach eliminates much of the server-side development typically required when working with Stripe directly, making it accessible even for teams with limited technical resources.\\n\\nThe integration also provides unified analytics across all payment sources:\\n\\n- Track web-based Stripe payments alongside app store purchases in a single dashboard.\\n- View consolidated subscription metrics without building custom analytics.\\n- Automatically grant access to paid features when users log in across devices.\\n- A/B test different payment flows without additional coding.\\n\\n## Looking ahead: The future of mobile payments\\n\\nThe April 2025 ruling marks a significant shift in how developers approach payment processing. Looking ahead, we can expect:\\n\\n### More payment options\\n\\nApps will increasingly offer multiple payment methods, with external options positioned as cost-saving alternatives to native systems. Expect to see apps highlighting the savings available through alternative payment methods.\\n\\n### Changing consumer behavior\\n\\nAs more apps add external payment options, users will become more comfortable with these alternative flows, particularly when the price difference is significant.\\n\\n## Is Stripe right for your app?\\n\\nThe answer depends on your specific situation:\\n\\n**For physical goods or real-world services:** Yes, use Stripe freely. This has always been permitted and remains the simplest use case.\\n\\n**For digital goods in the U.S. after May 2025:** Yes, you can now link to external checkout. The new ruling gives you freedom to direct users to Stripe from within your app.\\n\\n**For global digital goods:** Follow platform-specific guidelines. Each region has different rules, so research thoroughly or use region-specific implementations.\\n\\n**For subscription businesses:** Consider a hybrid approach. Offer both native IAP and Stripe options to maximize conversion and minimize platform fees.\\n\\nThe landscape is evolving in favor of developer choice and flexibility. By staying informed about the latest platform policies and implementing payment systems strategically, you can optimize both user experience and your bottom line.\\n\\n_Your next step_: Evaluate your app’s category, target regions, and technical resources to determine if Stripe integration is right for you. If it is, consider using integration platforms like Adapty to accelerate implementation.\\n\\n→ [Book a friendly call](https://adapty.io/schedule-demo/) with our team to find out more on Stripe integration.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_This article was last updated on May 9, 2025, and reflects the current App Store policies as of this date. Always check the latest platform guidelines before implementing payment systems in your app._\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### Is it legal to use Stripe for in-app purchases?\\n\\nYes, it is legal to use Stripe for in-app purchases in certain circumstances. Following the April 2025 Epic v. Apple ruling, apps in the U.S. App Store can include links to external payment systems for digital goods. For physical goods and real-world services, Stripe has always been allowed. However, regulations vary by region, so it’s essential to check the specific rules for your target markets.\\n\\n### What is the difference in fees between Stripe and App Store/Google Play?\\n\\nStripe charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, while Apple and Google charge 15-30% of the transaction value. For a $10 subscription, you would pay approximately $0.59 with Stripe versus $1.50-$3.00 with platform fees.\\n\\n### Can I offer both in-app purchases and Stripe payments in my app?\\n\\nYes, many developers implement a hybrid approach, offering both native in-app purchases and external payment options through Stripe where permitted. This maximizes conversion by giving users choice while potentially reducing platform fees on some transactions.\\n\\n### Does the April 2025 ruling apply worldwide?\\n\\nNo, the April 2025 Epic v. Apple ruling specifically applies to the United States App Store only. Other regions have different regulations. For example, the European Union has its own Digital Markets Act, and South Korea has implemented separate rules regarding payment systems.\\n\\n### How do I implement Stripe checkout in my iOS app?\\n\\nTo implement Stripe checkout, you need to:\\n\\n1. Create a button in your app that triggers a server request.\\n2. Set up a server to create Stripe checkout sessions.\\n3. Open the checkout URL in a browser using `UIApplication.shared.open(url)`\\n4. Implement Universal Links to return users to your app after payment.\\n5. Verify payment status via Stripe webhooks.\\n\\n### Do I need my own server to use Stripe for in-app purchases?\\n\\nYes, implementing Stripe requires server-side development to create checkout sessions and process webhooks. However, integration platforms like Adapty can handle much of this server-side complexity for you.\\n\\n### How do I handle user accounts across platforms?\\n\\nYou need to maintain a user identification system that works across your app and website. This typically involves:\\n\\n1. Creating a user account system.\\n2. Storing purchase entitlements in a database.\\n3. Verifying user status on login.\\n4. Synchronizing subscription status across platforms.\\n\\n### What’s the easiest way to integrate Stripe without extensive development?\\n\\nIntegration platforms like Adapty provide a simplified process:\\n\\n1. Install the platform’s app to your Stripe account.\\n2. Copy and paste your API keys.\\n3. Let the platform handle webhook configuration.\\n4. Use their SDK to verify purchase status in your app.\\n\\n### Will using external payment reduce conversion rates?\\n\\nExternal payment flows typically reduce conversion rates by 20-30% compared to native purchases due to the extra steps involved. However, the lower price point often allowed by saving on platform fees can offset this reduction, potentially resulting in higher overall revenue.\\n\\n### How can I improve conversion rates for external payments?\\n\\nTo improve conversion rates for external Stripe payments:\\n\\n1. Create a seamless visual transition to the browser.\\n2. Clearly explain the price benefit.\\n3. Implement Universal Links for automatic return to the app.\\n4. Save user selection state during the payment process.\\n5. A/B test different presentations of payment options.\\n\\n### Should I charge different prices for in-app purchases vs. Stripe?\\n\\nMany developers offer lower prices through external payment methods to reflect the lower processing fees and to incentivize users to choose this option despite the additional steps. For example, offering a $7.99 price point via Stripe versus $9.99 via in-app purchase.\\n\\n### How do users get access to their purchases across platforms?\\n\\nUsers typically need to create an account that works across your app and website. When they make a purchase on either platform, their entitlements are stored in your database and can be accessed from any device where they log in.\\n\\n### Which app categories benefit most from using Stripe?\\n\\nSubscription-based apps with high average revenue per user typically benefit most from using Stripe, as the fee savings compound over the lifetime of the subscription. Apps with large purchases or frequent transactions also see significant benefits.\\n\\n### How much development time should I budget for Stripe integration?\\n\\nDirect Stripe integration typically requires 2-4 weeks of development time for server setup, checkout implementation, and webhook processing. Using integration platforms can reduce this to days or even hours.\\n\\n### How quickly will I receive payments with Stripe vs. App Store?\\n\\nStripe typically settles funds within 2-7 days, while Apple and Google operate on 30-60 day payout cycles. This faster access to revenue can significantly improve cash flow, especially for growing businesses.\\n\\n### Can I use Stripe for one-time purchases or only subscriptions?\\n\\nStripe supports both one-time purchases and subscriptions. You can implement either model or combine them, depending on your business needs.\\n\\n### Can Apple reject my app for including Stripe payments?\\n\\nFollowing the April 2025 ruling, Apple cannot reject apps in the U.S. App Store solely for including links to external payment systems for digital goods. However, your implementation must still comply with all other App Store guidelines.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Start with exact match. Target 70-90% Share of Voice. Focus on ROAS over everything else. Most campaign structures break at scale._\\n\\nApple Ads can either be a goldmine or a money pit. The difference between profitable campaigns and budget-burning disasters comes down to execution fundamentals that most advertisers get wrong.\\n\\nHere’s what you need to know to run profitable [Apple Search Ads](https://adapty.io/blog/apple-search-ads/) campaigns without wasting your budget on common mistakes.\\n\\n## Should I use Basic or Advanced mode for Apple Ads?\\n\\nMost Apple Ads advice starts with the wrong premise. The conventional wisdom _start broad, let Apple learn, gradually optimize_ sounds reasonable but wastes money and time.\\n\\nHere’s what actually happens when you follow standard advice: Broad match burns budget on irrelevant traffic, Apple’s “learning phase” means weeks of poor performance, and you end up optimizing campaigns built on shaky foundations.\\n\\nAlways work in Advanced mode **.** Every profitable campaign I’ve analyzed uses Advanced mode exclusively.\\n\\n## How much should I spend testing Apple Ads keywords?\\n\\nYour goal isn’t to test everything. It’s to quickly identify which markets and keywords can profitably drive users for your app. This requires strategic focus, not scattered testing.\\n\\n### Geographic strategy based on real data\\n\\nThe biggest mistake I see is treating all international markets the same. They’re not. Each market has distinct competitive dynamics, user behavior patterns, and economic realities.\\n\\n**Always separate the US market.** It deserves dedicated campaigns because the competitive landscape and CPC levels make it impossible to optimize alongside other regions.\\n\\nFor international expansion, create strategic tiers:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: UK, Germany, Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, etc.\\n- **Tier 2**: Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, etc.\\n\\nThey’re based on iOS market penetration, GDP per capita, and advertising competition levels. Tier 2 markets often deliver better ROAS because competition is lower while purchasing power remains decent.\\n\\n**Don’t automatically dismiss emerging markets**, but approach them strategically. Latin America and APAC can work brilliantly for apps with strong local appeal or competitive pricing. However, they require more time and budget to find profitable keywords, so tackle them after you’ve mastered Tier 1 and Tier 2.\\n\\n**Budget allocation principle.** Start with maximum two tier campaigns. Concentrate your budget for faster, cleaner learning.\\n\\n### **The Exact Match reality check**\\n\\nHere’s an uncomfortable truth most guides won’t tell you: broad match rarely delivers meaningful insights.\\n\\nBroad match problems are systemic:\\n\\n- Apple’s interpretation of “broad” often includes wildly irrelevant traffic.\\n- You get mixed traffic quality that’s impossible to optimize effectively.\\n\\nStart with exact match campaigns built on solid keyword research instead. This approach works because you’re targeting pre-validated, high-intent search terms from day one.\\n\\nThe research-first methodology:\\n\\n1. Use multiple keyword tools to identify relevant search terms in your category.\\n2. Launch exact match campaigns with thematic keyword groupings.\\n3. Structure as one theme per ad group (habit tracker general, meditation specific, water tracking specific).\\n4. Skip the expensive “discovery” phase entirely.\\n\\n## How do I scale Apple Search Ads campaigns?\\n\\nThrowing more money at the same campaign structure is the fastest way to tank your ROAS. The campaigns that worked for research will actively hurt you at scale.\\n\\n### Why research structures fail at scale\\n\\nThe campaign structure that worked for discovery creates systematic problems when you’re trying to scale.\\n\\nApple doesn’t distribute impressions evenly across keywords within ad groups. Some keywords dominate while others get starved of traffic. You can’t control spend per keyword except through bidding wars. Multiple keywords per ad group create mixed traffic quality that becomes impossible to optimize.\\n\\n**The solution**: Evolve to granular structures that give you precise control over budget allocation and performance optimization.\\n\\n### Campaign architecture\\n\\n**Level 1 scaling: Keyword-focused structure**\\n\\n- One campaign per winning geo\\n- Mix of SKAG (Single Keyword Ad Groups) for high-volume terms\\n- Multi-keyword ad groups for smaller, thematically related terms\\n- 100% exact match keywords for traffic quality\\n\\n**Level 2 scaling: Strategic segmentation**\\n\\n- Separate campaigns by theme combined with keyword ARPU potential\\n- High-ARPU keywords get dedicated campaigns with aggressive bidding strategies\\n- Lower-ARPU keywords grouped for operational efficiency\\n- This segmentation matters more than difficulty scores or popularity metrics\\n\\n**Level 3 scaling: Maximum granularity for winners**\\n\\n- Individual campaigns for absolute best-performing keywords\\n- Custom Product Pages aligned to specific keyword intent\\n- Dedicated budget allocation based on strategic priority and profit potential\\n\\nWatch our detailed walkthrough of the Apple Ads campaign structure with OtherWayAround to identify profitable terms before launching campaigns:\\n\\n### The share of voice strategy\\n\\nTarget 70-90% Share of Voice for your best-performing keywords but only while ROAS stays strong. This metric lives in Custom Reports and shows how much available traffic you’re actually grabbing. Most people completely ignore it.\\n\\nHere’s what actually happens: Most advertisers think their bids are “high enough” when they’re capturing 30% of available impressions. Meanwhile, competitors are scooping up the other 70% of potentially profitable traffic.\\n\\nKeep pushing your SoV higher until ROAS starts tanking that’s when you stop. Don’t assume high Share of Voice will kill your margins without testing it. You might find that 80% SoV at 3.5x ROAS brings in way more total profit than 30% SoV at 4.2x ROAS.\\n\\n**Bid optimization methodology**:\\n\\n1. No delivery → increase bids aggressively until you see traffic.\\n2. Getting spend but low SoV → gradually increase bids to hit 70-90% range.\\n3. High SoV but poor ROAS → question keyword relevance or pause.\\n\\nMost advertisers obsess over finding the “perfect” CPC. Wrong focus. You want to capture enough share of profitable traffic to make scaling work, even if individual clicks cost more than you’d prefer.\\n\\n## What are the best Apple Ads optimization tactics?\\n\\n### Campaign structure evolution for maximum control\\n\\nAs your campaigns mature, you’ll hit Apple’s delivery limitations even with tight keyword structures. Adding more campaigns won’t solve this. Apple matches your app + keyword combination regardless of how you structure things.\\n\\nThe solution: Fix your [App Ads optimization](https://adapty.io/apple-ads-manager) first.\\n\\nApple factors your app’s organic relevance before considering your bid. When your app ranks organically for a keyword, your Apple Ads become more competitive. Higher relevance drops your CPCs and improves ROAS.\\n\\nAdvanced keyword strategies:\\n\\n- Target branded terms where you already rank organically\\n- Build campaigns around your strongest ASO keywords\\n- Use Apple Ads data to identify which keywords need ASO work\\n\\nApps that dominate Apple Ads have strong organic rankings for their target keywords. Campaign proliferation just creates management overhead without improving delivery.omplexity but guarantees every keyword gets auction participation.\\n\\n### Creative optimization that moves revenue\\n\\n[Custom Product Pages](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/custom-product-pages/) can dramatically improve campaign performance but only when implemented strategically.\\n\\nThe approach that works:\\n\\n- Start with your top 10 highest-spending, highest-ROAS keywords\\n- Create CPPs that showcase relevant features prominently in first-view screenshots\\n- Example: “habit tracker” searches should immediately see habit tracking functionality\\n- Measure concrete IPM improvements and ROAS impact before expanding\\n\\nCustom Product Pages work because they increase ad relevance, which Apple rewards with lower CPCs and higher impression priority. The time investment only makes sense for keywords already driving meaningful profitable volume.\\n\\n## What Apple Search Ads metrics should I focus on?\\n\\n### The only metric worth optimizing\\n\\n**ROAS is everything.** Not CPC. Not CPI. Not tap-through rates. Only ROAS tells you whether campaigns generate profitable growth.\\n\\n**Attribution setup with Adapty.** Setting up proper ROAS tracking is simpler than most people think. If you’re using Adapty for your subscription management, you can connect with one-click Apple OAuth directly through Adapty’s integration. This gives you clean revenue attribution down to the keyword level without complex MMP setups.\\n\\n![Adapty dashboard showing Apple Ads campaigns with ROAS tracking - campaigns in Japan and US with ROAS ranging from 106% to 177%](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2022/12/Adapty_ads_manager.webp)\\n\\nFor apps not using Adapty for subscription management, you can still install the Adapty SDK in observer mode to get clean Apple Ads attribution without changing your existing payment setup. This gives you the same seamless ROAS tracking without migrating your entire subscription system.\\n\\n### How should I set my Apple Ads bids?\\n\\n**Skip CPA goals for most campaigns.** They’re another algorithmic black box that limits control during crucial optimization phases. Manual bidding provides the precision needed for profitable scaling.\\n\\n**Effective manual bidding approach**:\\n\\n- Start conservative based on realistic CPA targets\\n- Use Share of Voice data to guide bid increases, not daily performance fluctuations\\n- Bid more aggressively for higher-ARPU keyword segments\\n- Conduct regular bid reviews based on ROAS trends, not emotional reactions to daily spending\\n\\nCPA goals make sense only for broad match or Search Match campaigns where you want algorithmic efficiency over granular control.\\n\\n## What Apple Ads mistakes should I avoid?\\n\\n### Research phase killers\\n\\n1. **Budget dispersion.** You spread $500 across five countries instead of testing one market properly. Result: weak signals everywhere, clear winners nowhere.\\n2. **Premature optimization.** Three days of data and you’re already reshuffling campaigns. You need weeks, not days, to see meaningful patterns.\\n3. **Vanity metric obsession.** Your CTR looks amazing but revenue is flat. Clicks don’t pay the bills.\\n\\n### Scaling phase failures\\n\\n1. **Over-segmentation.** You’ve got 47 campaigns that each need daily attention. The time you spend managing them could be better spent finding new profitable keywords.\\n2. **Bid ceiling mentality.** “I never bid above $2 CPC” sounds smart until you realize competitors are capturing all the $3 CPC traffic that converts at 5x ROAS.\\n3. **Attribution blindness.** That keyword looks expensive until you realize it drives 40% more lifetime value than your “cheap” keywords.\\n\\n### Strategic blunders\\n\\n1. **Generic advice following.** What works for a meditation app won’t work for a productivity tool. Cookie-cutter strategies create cookie-cutter results.\\n2. **Platform abandonment.** You gave Apple Ads two weeks, called it broken, then watched competitors dominate your keywords for months.\\n3. **Short-term thinking.** Apple Ads isn’t Facebook. Expecting day-one profitability is like expecting a sourdough starter to work on Tuesday.\\n\\n## The bottom line\\n\\nApple Ads profitability requires disciplined execution of basic fundamentals combined with systematic testing.\\n\\nAdvanced mode exclusively, research-driven exact match campaigns, comprehensive ROAS attribution, and relentless optimization based on Share of Voice and profitability metrics.\\n\\nResearch systematically to identify winners, scale strategically while maintaining performance quality, and optimize continuously based on revenue data rather than vanity metrics.\\n\\nMost advertisers will struggle with this approach because it requires patience, analytical discipline, and genuine commitment to data-driven decision making. The ones who master these principles will have massive competitive advantages in increasingly competitive auctions.\\n\\nWant to revisit step-by-step setup fundamentals?

Plan for 60-90 days to properly optimize and scale profitable campaigns.\\n\\n### Should I use broad match or exact match keywords?\\n\\nStart with exact match based on solid keyword research. Broad match burns budget on irrelevant traffic and provides noisy data that’s hard to optimize.\\n\\n### What’s a good ROAS target for Apple Ads?\\n\\nThis depends entirely on your app’s economics. Calculate your target based on user lifetime value, payback period requirements, and profit margins. Many successful apps target 3 ROAS.\\n\\n### How much budget do I need to test Apple Ads effectively?\\n\\nStart with at least $1,000 per market to get statistically significant results. Less budget leads to premature optimization decisions based on insufficient data.\\n\\n### Can small apps compete with big advertisers on Apple Ads?\\n\\nAbsolutely. Focus on Tier 2 markets, long-tail keywords, and specific user intents where competition is lower. Many small apps find profitable niches that big advertisers overlook.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

The problems started around 7:00 AM GMT and didn’t let up for over 15 hours. Since US-East-1 is AWS’s oldest and biggest cluster, the damage was extensive — over 1,000 companies experienced downtime, including ChatGPT, Lyft, Facebook, Duolingo, Zoom, Reddit, Venmo, and Coinbase. People couldn’t withdraw cash, book flights, or summon rides. A Premier League match lost its automated offside detection. The outage was so overwhelming it dominated news cycles worldwide, with major outlets like BBC running live coverage.\\n\\n![Outage 2 BI](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/outage_2_BI-1024x947.webp)**Screenshot of Downdetector showing websites and apps reporting issue**\\n\\nThe AWS disaster didn’t touch a single Adapty client, even though we partly rely on AWS infrastructure too. When our clients use Adapty, they’re trusting us with their entire payment infrastructure. Over 15,000 mobile apps depend on us staying online. If Adapty goes down, our clients stop making money. Their users literally cannot buy subscriptions. Since infrastructure _is_ our product, reliability isn’t a feature. That’s the whole point.\\n\\n## Building infrastructure that refuses to break\\n\\nAdapty runs on hybrid infrastructure — part on-premise servers, part cloud services. We use load balancers to distribute traffic and obsess over redundancy. The core philosophy: don’t depend on any single cloud provider. Make the system work under _any_ scenario. Even if the rest of the internet is on fire (though at that point, we’d all have bigger problems).\\n\\nAdditionally, we operate a global CDN with over 400 locations. This lets us process requests locally. Your API call gets answered by whichever server is geographically closest. That architectural decision matters when you’re handling over 4 billion requests daily, sometimes spiking to 10 billion.\\n\\n## Fallback mechanisms: The paywall must always load\\n\\nWe can invest in redundancy and architect for failure, but we’ll never reach 100% uptime. AWS can knock out entire regions. CDNs can hiccup. Networks fail in unexpected ways. What we don’t accept is our clients losing revenue because of it. So we built fallbacks for every conceivable failure scenario.\\n\\nBuying a subscription breaks down into three stages.\\n\\n### First: Display the paywall and products\\n\\nThe paywall is everything in a subscription app. It must load every single time, regardless of infrastructure chaos or internet problems.\\n\\nNormally, the Adapty SDK makes an HTTP request to our server. All backend requests route through our CDN. If the paywall is cached there, that’s what displays. It’s much faster than waiting for a full server response. No CDN cache? The response comes from Adapty’s backend. Backend unavailable _and_ no CDN cache? A locally cached paywall loads.\\n\\nIn case everything fails and there’s no local cache either — say, the user just installed the app — our “fallback backend” activates. We built this specifically as insurance, with 99.999999999% uptime. It stores paywalls for all placements. And if somehow _that_ fails, a local [fallback paywall](https://adapty.io/docs/fallback-paywalls) loads (assuming the developer configured one).\\n\\n### Second: Process the payment\\n\\nThis happens entirely on Apple or Google’s side. We can’t add safety nets here, but we trust these companies to handle payments reliably.\\n\\n### Third: Grant the subscription entitlements\\n\\nAfter payment, the backend must process that transaction and assign the appropriate user entitlement. Otherwise you get a nightmare: payment succeeded, subscription didn’t activate.\\n\\nThe latest version of the Adapty iOS SDK addresses this by saving entitlements locally if our backend is unreachable. The user experience stays intact. We’re rolling this out across all our other SDKs.\\n\\n## Continuous optimization\\n\\nAdapty maintains 99.99% uptime with a dedicated 20-person team monitoring infrastructure 24/7/365. There’s always an engineer on duty. We use Grafana, pinging our infrastructure from eight global checkpoints every 15 seconds, tracking response codes and latency. If a ping fails, an alert fires. If that alert isn’t resolved in 5 minutes, it escalates to DevOps. We catch problems immediately and fix them fast.\\n\\nBeyond monitoring, we’re constantly optimizing. Recently, we [moved A/B test processing through the CDN](https://adapty.io/blog/adapty-may-2024-updates/), dropping paywall load times in those tests to 300-500 milliseconds. Adapty holds SOC 2 Type 2 certification, which confirms we’ve built robust availability monitoring.\\n\\nComputers are hard. Keeping them running is harder. But when 15,000 apps depend on your infrastructure to make money, you don’t have the luxury of downtime.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Flutter\\n\\nLast updated October 21, 2025\\n\\nby\\n\\n[![](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/04/adapty-ben-gohlke-512x512.webp)](https://adapty.io/author/bgohlke/)\\n\\n[Ben Gohlke](https://adapty.io/author/bgohlke/)\\n\\nPublished August 18, 2025\\n\\nLast updated October 21, 2025\\n\\n14 min read\\n\\n![Quickstart Guide Flutter](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/Quickstart-Guide_Flutter.png)\\n\\nGet from zero Adapty setup to displaying a paywall and processing purchases in under 60 minutes.\\n\\n## Pre-requisites\\n\\nBefore you begin, make sure you have:\\n\\n- A working Flutter app with iOS deployment configured\\n- Flutter SDK 3.0 or later\\n- iOS development environment (Xcode, CocoaPods)\\n- At least one in-app purchase product created in App Store Connect\\n- An [Adapty account](https://app.adapty.io/signup) with your app added to the dashboard, including at least one product, paywall, and placement\\n\\n## Project files\\n\\nTo follow along with this tutorial, [download the project files from GitHub](https://github.com/adaptyteam/Focus-Journal-Flutter). The `starter` branch contains the app without Adapty integration, while the `main` branch contains the finished project.\\n\\n## Install the Adapty SDK in your project\\n\\nAdd the Adapty Flutter SDK to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\\n\\n```\\ndependencies:\\n  flutter:\\n    sdk: flutter\\n    # Add the following to your dependencies list\\n      adapty_flutter: ^3.10.0\\n```\\n\\n```\\ndependencies:\\n  flutter:\\n    sdk: flutter\\n    # Add the following to your dependencies list\\n      adapty_flutter: ^3.10.0\\n```\\n\\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.\\n\\n### iOS Configuration\\n\\nSince Flutter apps require native iOS configuration for in-app purchases, run the following:\\n\\n```\\ncd ios && pod install && cd ..\\n```\\n\\n```\\ncd ios && pod install && cd ..\\n```\\n\\n## Initialize Adapty in your app\\n\\nFirst, add these constants to your existing constants management system:\\n\\n```\\nclass AppConstants {\\n  static const String apiKey = \\\"API key goes here\\\";\\n  static const String accessLevelId = \\\"premium\\\";\\n  static const String placementId = \\\"on_tap_history\\\";\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\nclass AppConstants {\\n  static const String apiKey = \\\"API key goes here\\\";\\n  static const String accessLevelId = \\\"premium\\\";\\n  static const String placementId = \\\"on_tap_history\\\";\\n}\\n```\\n\\n🔐 Find your public SDK key: [Adapty Dashboard > Settings > API Keys](https://app.adapty.io/settings)\\n\\nNext, initialize Adapty in your `main.dart` file:\\n\\n```\\n// Add these import statements to the existing ones:\\nimport 'package:adapty_flutter/adapty_flutter.dart';\\nimport 'constants.dart';\\n\\nvoid main() async {\\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\\n\\n  try {\\n    // Initialize Adapty with API key\\n    await Adapty().activate(configuration: AdaptyConfiguration(\\n       apiKey: AppConstants.apiKey,\\n    ));\\n\\n    // Set up profile update listener\\n    Adapty().didUpdateProfileStream.listen((profile) {\\n      profileManager.onProfileUpdate(profile);\\n    });\\n  } catch (e) {\\n    throw Exception('Failed to initialize Adapty: $e');\\n  }\\n\\n  runApp(FocusJournalApp(profileManager: profileManager));\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\n// Add these import statements to the existing ones:\\nimport 'package:adapty_flutter/adapty_flutter.dart';\\nimport 'constants.dart';\\n\\nvoid main() async {\\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\\n\\n  try {\\n    // Initialize Adapty with API key\\n    await Adapty().activate(configuration: AdaptyConfiguration(\\n       apiKey: AppConstants.apiKey,\\n    ));\\n\\n    // Set up profile update listener\\n    Adapty().didUpdateProfileStream.listen((profile) {\\n      profileManager.onProfileUpdate(profile);\\n    });\\n  } catch (e) {\\n    throw Exception('Failed to initialize Adapty: $e');\\n  }\\n\\n  runApp(FocusJournalApp(profileManager: profileManager));\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis code configures and activates the Adapty SDK.\\n\\n## Set up profile handling\\n\\nNext, edit the file `lib/providers/profile_manager.dart` to add Adapty integration.\\n\\nThe primary changes are the addition of the Adapty profile property, the call to update the profile, and the updating of premium status based on the contents of the profile object.\\n\\n```\\n// Add these imports to the existing ones:\\nimport 'package:adapty_flutter/adapty_flutter.dart';\\nimport '../constants.dart';\\n\\nclass ProfileManager extends ChangeNotifier {\\n  // Add this property to your list of properties\\n  AdaptyProfile? _customerProfile;\\n  ...\\n\\n  // Add this getter\\n  AdaptyProfile? get customerProfile => _customerProfile;\\n  ...\\n\\n  Future<void> refreshProfile() async {\\n    _setLoading(true);\\n    _setError(null);\\n\\n    try {\\n      // Remove the network call delay and replace with:\\n      final profile = await Adapty().getProfile();\\n      _customerProfile = profile;\\n      _updatePremiumStatus();\\n      _setLoading(false);\\n    } catch (e) {\\n      _setError(\\\"Failed to refresh profile: $e\\\");\\n      _setLoading(false);\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  // Add this function to your profile_manager\\n  void _updatePremiumStatus() {\\n    if (_customerProfile == null) {\\n      _isPremium = false;\\n      return;\\n    }\\n\\n    final accessLevel = _customerProfile!.accessLevels[AppConstants.accessLevelId];\\n\\n    if (accessLevel == null) {\\n      _isPremium = false;\\n      return;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Check for active, grace period, or lifetime access\\n    _isPremium = accessLevel.isActive ||\\n                 accessLevel.isInGracePeriod ||\\n                 accessLevel.isLifetime;\\n\\n    notifyListeners();\\n  }\\n\\n  // Add this function to your profile_manager:\\n  void onProfileUpdate(AdaptyProfile profile) {\\n    _customerProfile = profile;\\n    _updatePremiumStatus();\\n  }\\n\\n  // All other functions in starter remain the same\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\n// Add these imports to the existing ones:\\nimport 'package:adapty_flutter/adapty_flutter.dart';\\nimport '../constants.dart';\\n\\nclass ProfileManager extends ChangeNotifier {\\n  // Add this property to your list of properties\\n  AdaptyProfile?

It’s designed to showcase the basics of interfacing with the Adapty SDK to get information on products and present them to the user. You also have the option of using our [Paywall Builder](https://adapty.io/paywall-builder/) feature to design and deploy paywalls from the Adapty dashboard without requiring a new submission to the App or Play stores.\\n\\n![IMG 2930](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2930-472x1024.png)\\n\\n## Update the main journal interface to show a paywall\\n\\nEdit the home\\\\_view.dart file to call the paywall instead of simulating a purchase:\\n\\n```\\nclass _HomeViewState extends State<HomeView> {\\n  ...\\n\\n  void _viewHistory() {\\n    final profileManager = context.read<ProfileManager>();\\n\\n    if (profileManager.isPremium) {\\n      Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/history');\\n    } else {\\n      // Remove the call to show the mock dialog and replace with:\\n      _showPaywall();\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  // Add this function\\n  void _showPaywall() async {\\n    if (!mounted) return;\\n\\n    final result = await Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/paywall');\\n\\n    // If purchase was successful, refresh profile and navigate to history\\n    if (result == true && mounted) {\\n      final profileManager = context.read<ProfileManager>();\\n      await profileManager.refreshProfile();\\n\\n      if (profileManager.isPremium && mounted) {\\n        Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/history');\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\nclass FocusJournalApp extends StatelessWidget {\\n  ...\\n\\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\\n    return ChangeNotifierProvider<ProfileManager>.value(\\n      ...\\n      child: MaterialApp(\\n        ...\\n        routes: {\\n          ...\\n          // Add this route to the Paywall View under the route for the History View\\n          '/paywall': (context) => const PaywallView(),\\n        },\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\nclass _HomeViewState extends State<HomeView> {\\n  ...\\n\\n  void _viewHistory() {\\n    final profileManager = context.read<ProfileManager>();\\n\\n    if (profileManager.isPremium) {\\n      Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/history');\\n    } else {\\n      // Remove the call to show the mock dialog and replace with:\\n      _showPaywall();\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  // Add this function\\n  void _showPaywall() async {\\n    if (!mounted) return;\\n\\n    final result = await Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/paywall');\\n\\n    // If purchase was successful, refresh profile and navigate to history\\n    if (result == true && mounted) {\\n      final profileManager = context.read<ProfileManager>();\\n      await profileManager.refreshProfile();\\n\\n      if (profileManager.isPremium && mounted) {\\n        Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/history');\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\nclass FocusJournalApp extends StatelessWidget {\\n  ...\\n\\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\\n    return ChangeNotifierProvider<ProfileManager>.value(\\n      ...\\n      child: MaterialApp(\\n        ...\\n        routes: {\\n          ...\\n          // Add this route to the Paywall View under the route for the History View\\n          '/paywall': (context) => const PaywallView(),\\n        },\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Check for purchases on app launch\\n\\nThe initialization code we added to `main.dart` handles checking subscription status when the app launches. The `ProfileManager` automatically updates the premium status based on the user’s access levels.\\n\\nHere’s how the purchase flow works:\\n\\n1. **App Launch**: `refreshProfile()` gets the latest subscription status\\n2. **Profile Updates**: The SDK automatically notifies your app when purchases are made\\n3. **Access Control**: The `isPremium` flag controls which features are available\\n\\n## Test your integration\\n\\nBuild and run your app:\\n\\n```\\nflutter build ios --no-codesign\\n```\\n\\n```\\nflutter build ios --no-codesign\\n```\\n\\nThe expected flow is as follows:\\n\\n- Load subscription status from Adapty on launch\\n- Show premium features to subscribers\\n- Display paywalls to non-subscribers\\n- Process purchases and unlock content immediately\\n\\n## Cross-Platform Considerations\\n\\nWhile this guide focuses on iOS, the Flutter implementation works on Android too. For Android deployment, you’ll need:\\n\\n- Google Play Console setup for in-app purchases\\n- Android-specific product configuration in Adapty\\n- Additional gradle configuration for billing permissions\\n\\nThe core Dart code remains identical across platforms.\\n\\n## Congrats!\\n\\nAt this point, your Flutter app:\\n\\n- Loads paywalls from Adapty using your remote configuration\\n- Lets users purchase subscriptions through native iOS interfaces\\n- Unlocks premium features based on access levels\\n- Handles subscription status automatically across app launches\\n- Uses Flutter best practices with Provider state management\\n\\nLearn more about [Flutter best practices with Adapty](https://adapty.io/docs/flutter-sdk-overview) in our documentation.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Flow](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/How-to-fix-your-app-onboarding-flow.webp)\\n\\n**TL;DR**\\n\\n- _Your onboarding is the single most critical flow in your app. Screw it up, and users bounce before they see your value._\\n- _Stop selling features. Users don’t care about your “AI-powered algorithm.” They care about saving time, reducing stress, or hitting their goals._\\n- _The right onboarding guides users to their “Aha!” moment fast, reduces friction with psychology, and tests relentlessly to find what converts._\\n\\nYour [onboarding](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/) is your first date with the user. If you lead with a boring slide deck about your “proprietary algorithm” or ask for their email before they’ve even seen why your app matters, you’ve already lost them. And unlike dating, you don’t get a second chance.\\n\\nMost apps treat onboarding as an afterthought. They slap together a few screens, hope users figure it out, and wonder why 80% drop off before hitting the paywall. This approach is a death sentence.\\n\\nBut here’s what makes onboarding so powerful: it’s one of the highest-leverage areas you can optimize. Small changes — a progress bar, a personalized question, a trust signal — can swing conversion rates by double digits. Here’s the guide to [building an onboarding flow](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-build-app-onboarding-flows-that-convert/) that converts, backed by real A/B test data from the apps we work with at Adapty.\\n\\n## **First principle: Stop selling features. Sell outcomes**\\n\\nThe first mistake most apps make happens before users even tap the first button. They showcase features instead of outcomes. Here’s what actually happens when you flip that script.\\n\\n### **Don’t sell features during onboarding. Sell the benefit**\\n\\nNobody cares about your “AI-powered recommendation engine.” They care about finding the perfect workout in 10 seconds or finally sticking to a meditation habit. Speak to the outcome, not the tech stack.\\n\\n![Blinkist Onboarding](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Blinkist-onboarding-1024x694.webp)_Blinkist gets it. ‘Understand powerful ideas in 15 mins’ beats ‘Access to thousands of summaries’ every time. They sell the transformation, not the inventory_\\n\\nHere’s an example from our experience: in one app from the productivity category, we tested two onboarding approaches: one that showcased features (“unlimited questions,” “fast responses”) and one that emphasized outcomes (“get answers to complex problems instantly”). The outcome-focused version lifted trial conversions by 17% and ARPU by 13%.\\n\\n### **First, articulate the pain. Then, show the cure**\\n\\nA powerful onboarding technique is first to articulate the user’s pain point — “Tired of messy notes?” — then immediately follow up with how your app is the solution. This problem-solution framing makes your value proposition crystal clear. When users see their own frustration reflected back at them, they’re primed to believe you have the answer.\\n\\n![Retake AI Face Onboarding](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Retake-AI-Face-onboarding-1024x517.webp)_Retake AI does this perfectly: ‘Don’t like your photo? Turn it into your best shot.’ Pain point → solution in one breath_\\n\\n### **You built the app for a reason. The user downloaded it for themselves**\\n\\nDive deep into what they hope to achieve. Is it to save time? Make more money? Reduce stress? Speak their language, not yours. If your onboarding copy could apply to any app in your category, you’re doing it wrong. Get specific about the transformation your app enables and who it’s for.\\n\\n_In [Adapty’s onboarding builder](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/?utm_campaign=29683057-GTM%20%7C%20Onboarding%20Builder&utm_source=blog&utm_content=how-to-fix-your-app-onboarding-flow), you control the narrative. Total freedom to write outcome-focused headlines, problem-solution framing, or whatever converts best for your audience_\\n\\nBut articulating the outcome is only half the battle. The other half is proving you can actually deliver on that promise — and you need to do it in seconds, not minutes.\\n\\n## **Second principle: Guide users to the “Aha!” moment fast**\\n\\nOnce you’ve told users what transformation they’ll get, you need to show them. This is where most [onboarding flows fall apart](https://adapty.io/blog/why-users-delete-your-app-in-24-hours/). They explain the app’s value in theory, then dump users into a complex interface and hope they figure it out. That’s not onboarding. That’s abandonment.\\n\\n### **Don’t hope users stumble upon your app’s magic. Design for it**\\n\\nYour onboarding should guide users directly to that “Aha!” moment — the instant they get why your app is fantastic. The faster they get there, the more likely they are to stick around. If your value isn’t evident in the first 60 seconds, you’re already bleeding users.\\n\\n![Robokiller Onboarding](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Robokiller-onboarding-1024x419.webp)_Robokiller nails the ‘Aha!’ moment by showing. That second screen — with the live spam call identified and blocked in real time — is where users go from ‘I think this might work’ to ‘I need this.’ Then they pile on trust signals and social proof to seal the deal_\\n\\nI’ve seen this play out clearly in an education app that tested three onboarding variations: a trial lesson-only, a survey-only, and a survey-plus-lesson. The survey-plus-lesson approach won decisively, with a 25% increase in trial starts and a 78% lift in ARPU. Why? Because it guided users to experience value immediately after personalizing their journey.\\n\\n### **If your app transforms something, show it**\\n\\nA powerful “before and after” visual helps users instantly grasp the value. Fitness apps do this well: show the transformation, not the feature list. It motivates users to get started because they can see the outcome they want. Whether it’s a polished photo, a completed task list, or an unlocked language skill, give users a glimpse of their future success.\\n\\n![YouCam Onboarding ](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/YouCam-onboarding--1024x411.webp)_YouCam Enhance demonstrates transformation across its entire onboarding. Each screen shows a before/after slider with a different use case: photo enhancement, lighting adjustments, and colorizatio_ n\\n\\nGetting users to the “Aha!” moment is critical, but there’s a way to make it even more powerful: tailor that moment to each user’s specific needs. That’s where personalization comes in — and the data on this is unambiguous.\\n\\n## **Third principle: Personalize the experience**\\n\\nGeneric onboarding treats every user the same. Personalized onboarding makes users feel understood from the first tap.\\n\\n### **In all our tests, a personalized onboarding flow crushed a generic one**\\n\\nAsk a few simple questions to tailor the experience. It makes the user feel understood. Our growth team ran a test with a productivity app comparing two onboarding versions: one with generic feature demos and social proof, and another that added personalization questions upfront with a loading screen that said “customizing your experience.” The personalized version delivered an 8.5% increase in trial starts, a 17% lift in paying conversions, and a 22% increase in overall ARPU. In the US market specifically, the gains were even more dramatic: paying conversions jumped 27% and ARPU rose 35%. So, personalization isn’t just nice-to-have.\\n\\n### **The right number of onboarding steps is the one that works for you**\\n\\nThere’s no magic number. After endless testing, you’ll find a balance between collecting enough info to personalize and keeping the flow short enough that users don’t bounce. Start with 3-5 steps and iterate from there.\\n\\n![Fabulous Onboarding 1](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Fabulous-onboarding-1-1024x140.webp)_Fabulous runs 42 onboarding screens. Does that mean you should, too? No. It means they found their number through relentless testing. You need to find yours_\\n\\nHere’s another example from our experience: one entertainment app tested a lengthy onboarding (with user questions, bot customization, stats, and loading screens) against no onboarding at all. The long version won with a 40% increase in payment conversions on iOS and 20% ARPU growth. But when they tried to shorten it, conversions dropped 13%. So, don’t assume shorter is always better. Test to find your sweet spot.\\n\\nThis brings up an important tension in onboarding design: you want to collect enough information to personalize the experience, but every field you add is another opportunity for users to drop off. The key is asking the right questions at the right time and cutting everything else.\\n\\n## **Fourth principle: Reduce friction with psychology**\\n\\nEvery element in your onboarding flow should either move users forward or be cut. Here’s how to identify and eliminate the friction that’s killing your conversions.\\n\\n### **Every extra field is another chance for users to drop off**\\n\\nUnless it’s essential for personalization or for the app’s core function, save it for later or don’t ask at all. If your app works fine without a user’s birthdate, don’t ask for it during onboarding. Every field you remove is a conversion win. We’ve seen sign-ups become one of the biggest drop-off points in onboarding. The more you can delay this step — or better yet, let users experience value first — the more users you’ll convert.\\n\\n### **If it’s not strictly necessary, never put a sign-up form before the user sees the core value or the paywall**\\n\\nSign-ups are friction. Let users experience your app first, then ask them to commit. You’ll convert more users and collect better data because they’re already invested. This approach works because it flips the psychology: instead of asking for trust upfront, you earn it by delivering value immediately.\\n\\n![Cleanup Onboarding 1](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Cleanup-onboarding-1-1024x356.webp)_Cleanup shows value first, asks for commitment last. Four screens demonstrating what you’ll get, then the trial. By that point, you already know it works_\\n\\n### **Ask users to commit with a small ritual**\\n\\nA subtle but powerful onboarding trick: ask users to commit with a small ritual. It could be drawing a checkmark, signing their name, or tapping ‘I promise.’ This small, unconscious commitment makes them more likely to follow through. It’s based on the psychological principle of consistency — once someone makes a micro-commitment, they’re more inclined to honor it.\\n\\n![Yazio Onboarding 1 2](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Yazio-onboarding-1-2-1024x677.webp)_Yazio uses a commitment ritual: tap and hold the icon to confirm your goal. That physical gesture creates a micro-commitment that increases follow-through_\\n\\n### **Use ‘Do you relate?’ statements**\\n\\nFor example, ‘Struggle to stay organized?’ When users tap yes, you’ve framed their pain and primed your app as the solution. It’s a psychological nudge that makes the value prop feel personal. This works because it creates instant empathy and positions your app as understanding their specific problem.\\n\\n_[Adapty’s onboarding builder](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/?utm_campaign=29683057-GTM%20%7C%20Onboarding%20Builder&utm_source=blog&utm_content=how-to-fix-your-app-onboarding-flow) comes with pre-built question templates you can customize instantly. Need a ‘Do you relate?’ screen? Use the multi-select template, swap in your copy, adjust the styling to match your brand, and you’re done_\\n\\n### **Ask a simple, positive question**\\n\\nLike, “Are you ready to improve your health?” The user will almost certainly tap “Yes.” This small, unconscious commitment makes them more likely to follow through with the rest of the onboarding. It’s the foot-in-the-door technique applied to mobile UX.\\n\\n### **Celebrate progress**\\n\\nAfter a user makes a choice or answers a question, show them a quick screen that says something like, “Great choice!” or “We’ve got you covered.” It’s a small psychological boost that makes the experience feel more like a supportive conversation. People stick with what makes them feel good. This approach works because positive reinforcement increases engagement and completion rates.\\n\\n![LingoTok Onboarding](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/LingoTok-onboarding-1024x669.webp)_LingoTok shows exactly how to do positive reinforcement right. Pick your learning goals → instant ‘Great choice!’ screen → social proof that others chose the same path_\\n\\nThese nudges work because they make the experience feel smooth and supportive. But here’s the other anxiety users carry: Is this app legit? Will it actually work? Trust signals answer those questions.\\n\\n## **Fifth principle: Build trust and momentum**\\n\\nNew users are inherently skeptical. They’ve downloaded dozens of apps that overpromised and underdelivered. Your job in onboarding is to prove you’re different — and you need to do it without breaking the flow.\\n\\n### **Incorporate trust signals right into your onboarding**\\n\\nThis can be anything from press mentions (“As seen in TechCrunch”) to user testimonials (“Join 50,000 happy users”). It tells new users they’re making a smart choice, not a risky one. But don’t cheat — if you don’t have the credentials, don’t fake them. Authenticity matters more than inflated numbers.\\n\\n![Lock In Onboarding](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Lock-In-onboarding-1024x415.webp)_Lock In runs a 33-step onboarding process and uses trust signals five times throughout. Expert-backed research, user testimonials, rating prompts, community feedback, and social proof numbers. They layer credibility at multiple touchpoints so users never question whether the app delivers_\\n\\n### **Loading screens are prime real estate**\\n\\nInstead of a blank spinner, show testimonials, ratings, or quick wins. It keeps users engaged and reinforces why they made the right choice. Wasted screen time is a wasted conversion opportunity. That said, test whether you even need the loading screen.\\n\\nI watched an education app test something simple: removing its onboarding loading screen entirely. Trial conversions jumped 22%, and ARPU rose 30%. Loading screens can work when they’re doing a job — but don’t keep one just because it feels like you should.\\n\\nOnce you’ve built trust through social proof and momentum, you’re in a position to ask for something more valuable: permissions. But here’s where most apps blow it: treating permissions as a transaction rather than a value exchange.\\n\\n## **Sixth principle: Handle permissions smartly**\\n\\nThe iOS notification prompt is one of the most important moments in your onboarding flow — and most apps waste it with a cold, contextless ask. Here’s how to frame permissions as benefits, not requests.\\n\\n### **Don’t just ask for notification permissions. Build a short flow that shows why they’re valuable**\\n\\nThe right context can turn a ‘No’ into a ‘Yes.’ Instead of hitting users with a cold permission request, explain what they’ll get: “Get daily reminders to stay on track” beats a generic iOS prompt. One education app tested setting up reminders during onboarding versus on the home screen. The in-onboarding version increased trial conversions by 6.4% and lifted ARPU by 24%. This approach works because you’re framing the ask around user benefit, not app functionality.\\n\\n![Permission Notification](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Permission-notification-1024x472.webp)_My teammate catalogs permission screens from top-performing apps. If you’re designing your own permission flow and want inspiration from apps that do it right, his library is [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLY8xmA8=/?share_link_id=744386008851)_\\n\\nNow here’s the hard truth: everything I’ve just outlined — selling outcomes, guiding to the “Aha!” moment, personalizing, reducing friction, building trust, handling permissions — none of it matters if you don’t test it. Because what works for one app won’t work for another, and what works today might not work next month.\\n\\n## **Seventh principle: Test everything**\\n\\nThe right onboarding is the one that converts. And you won’t find it without testing. What works for a meditation app won’t work for a fintech app. A/B test step count, copy, visuals, and CTAs.\\n\\n## **Why I’m writing this now**\\n\\nFull transparency: I got the idea for this article right after getting access to Adapty’s onboarding builder. And honestly, I was blown away.\\n\\nHere’s the context. Everything I just shared — the seven principles, the A/B test results, the tactics that work — came from apps that had to fight for dev resources every time they wanted to test a new onboarding flow. Every experiment meant tickets, sprints, QA, and app store review. Weeks to launch a single test.\\n\\nMost apps settle for mediocre onboarding, not because they don’t know what works, but because the cost of testing is too high.\\n\\nWhat hit me was seeing what’s possible when you remove that bottleneck. I could suddenly design, personalize, and A/B-test onboarding flows without writing code or waiting for releases. Quizzes, progress bars, testimonials, paywall handoffs — all from a visual editor. Real-time experiments. No dev cycles.\\n\\n_This is what I mean. Drag in a quiz block, customize the questions, add a progress bar, and connect it to your paywall. No code, no tickets, no waiting. You can build and test an entire onboarding flow in the time it used to take just to write the spec doc_\\n\\nThat’s what changed for me. Not the features. The speed. If you’re serious about onboarding, that’s the unlock worth paying attention to.\\n\\n→ [Check out Adapty’s onboarding builder](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/?utm_campaign=29683057-GTM%20%7C%20Onboarding%20Builder&utm_source=blog&utm_content=how-to-fix-your-app-onboarding-flow)\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### How many onboarding steps should I have?\\n\\nThere’s no magic number. Start with 3–5 and test. The goal is to balance personalization with speed. Some apps win with long, detailed onboarding (one entertainment app saw +40% conversions with a lengthy flow); others convert better with just a few screens. Let the data decide.\\n\\n### Should I show the paywall during onboarding or after?\\n\\nTest both. Some apps convert better with an in-flow paywall. Others do better showing value first, then monetizing. The key is making sure users understand your value before asking them to pay.\\n\\n### Do I need developer resources to build great onboarding?\\n\\nNot anymore. Tools like Adapty’s no-code onboarding builder let non-technical teams design and iterate on onboarding without waiting on developers.\\n\\n### How do I know if my onboarding is too long?\\n\\nTrack drop-off rates at each step. If you’re losing more than 20–30% of users at any single screen, that’s a red flag. Test shorter versions or reframe the value at that step.\\n\\n### Should I ask for permissions during onboarding or later?\\n\\nIt depends on the permission. Notifications can work well in onboarding if you frame the value clearly (“Get daily reminders to stay on track”). Location or contacts? Save those for when they’re contextually relevant to a feature the user is trying to use.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

The statistics show that mobile app developers and publishers that run paywall experiments can [make up to 100x more app revenue](https://adapty.io/state-of-in-app-subscriptions/). Yet, this marketing tool has been lately covered with a plethora of myths concerning its effectiveness, safety issues, and being overrated in general.\\n\\nIn this article, we’ll take the role of myth-busters and try to disprove some of the most popular myths circulating around paywall A/B testing. We’ll provide more context to the myths to show that they are mostly based on the lack of information or someone’s bad experience. In addition to that, we’d also cover several common mistakes that prevent people from utilizing A/B testing to 100%. Let’s start with the myths first.\\n\\n## Myths\\n\\nI’ve met people from the mobile app industry who avoid paywall A/B testing like the plague, claiming that it’s unsafe, complicated, and takes more time than provides final value. In this part, we’ll take a look at a few common myths and misconceptions regarding paywall A/B testing and see that they are either not true or simply rudimentary prejudice.\\n\\n### Myth \\\\#1: Using remote config for testing paywalls can get your app in trouble\\n\\n![image 8](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-8.jpeg)\\n\\nThis is one of the most popular and common myths circulating in the mobile app community. Everyone in the industry has heard stories of this or that app getting banned and deleted by the App Store for guidelines violations. Of course, Apple is rather strict when it comes to rules and regulations, but they’re also pretty consistent in this matter, meaning they actually go by the book and do not go beyond what’s included in their guidelines.\\n\\nIf you’re new to A/B testing: [remote config](https://adapty.io/blog/what-is-remote-config/) is a feature that enables you to remotely change an interface element with the help of placeholder variables inserted in the code beforehand which can later be tweaked via JSON file. Such manipulations let you change elements in your app or software without having to release an update or a new version.\\n\\nThe requirement that is feared the most in such cases is [2.5.2 of the Software Requirements](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements) which states: _“Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code which introduces or changes features or functionality of the app, including other apps”._ Well, it’s a pretty reasonable point, but it doesn’t relate to the use of 3rd party frameworks and remote config for paywalls. Here are a few points to bust this myth:\\n\\n- **The code is never changed**. The working principle of remote config is the substitution of one piece of content with another (for example a background image). To do that, you insert placeholder variables in your app’s code in advance. Such a variable is attached to a certain content piece in the framework that you use. So the code is the same, but the chosen paywall element can now be changed multiple times.\\n- **Even Firebase features remote config**. [Firebase](https://adapty.io/integrations/google-analytics-firebase/), an app development platform **powered by Google**, also features an A/B testing feature based on remote config. The use of such a feature by the owners of the second-largest app store shows that it’s an absolutely safe-to-use instrument.\\n- **3rd parties’ software is not a threat**. Many fear using the remote config of 3rd party frameworks because it may count as the “outside” functionality. But in reality, you can create the same in-house backend infrastructure and integrate it with your app. The main point is that it will be [extremely expensive and hard to maintain](https://adapty.io/compare/in-house-development/), but still. 3rd party SDKs do not add any “outside” functionality, they work within the guidelines.\\n- **Some of the most popular app publishers use it**. If you think that most of the popular apps in your preferred app store made it to the top just because they provide valuable content, it’s far from reality. In order to grow in revenue and conversions, you need to constantly experiment and look for new ways to acquire a new audience. The only way to experiment with paywalls is through remote config (or paywall builder, but we’ll talk about it in a bit). You can get familiar with some of the remarkable experiments of our clients in [our case studies](https://adapty.io/case-studies/).\\n\\nTo sum it up, the remote config or any other A/B testing platform that is based on it is safe to use in your app for testing or changing your paywall. Moreover, it may even be viewed as a test platform for providing the best user experience in your app, which is beneficial for the App Store itself.\\n\\n### Myth \\\\#2: Firebase is more than enough to test mobile paywalls\\n\\n![image 7](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-7.jpeg)\\n\\nWhen you finally decide to try running A/B tests for your paywalls, you start searching for a tool that should be preferably free and well-known. The first framework that pops up is usually **Firebase**. And it’s pretty clear why: Knowing that it’s powered by Google and has tons of tutorials can make you think that it must be a pretty reliable framework, working with which is going to be a walk in the park. But it’s not that simple.\\n\\nEven though Firebase enables app developers to run A/B tests in their apps, it was not designed to experiment with paywalls. We have already [prolifically investigated this matter](https://adapty.io/blog/firebase-a-b-testing-mobile-app-paywalls/), but let’s go through the main takeaways once again:\\n\\n- **Not designed for paywall testing:** The platform’s focus is on general mobile app experience testing and improving messaging rather than specialized paywall experimentation.\\n- **Setup complexity**: Setting up a paywall A/B test with Firebase involves several additional steps, such as integrating Firebase SDK and Google Analytics for Firebase SDK, codifying paywalls, and custom coding for capturing revenue data points.\\n- **Limited documentation**: Firebase’s documentation and landing page for A/B testing do not explicitly mention paywall testing. This lack of emphasis indicates that paywall testing is considered “just another use case”.\\n- **Insufficient data reporting**: Firebase requires additional custom coding to set up recommended and custom events in Google Analytics to capture necessary data for paywall experiments.\\n- **Need for third-party analytics tools**: The limitations in Firebase’s default analytics mean that users may need to integrate third-party analytics tools to collect missing revenue data.\\n- **Limited segmenting for paywall testing**: Firebase offers predefined audience segments and supports custom audiences based on certain data points. However, creating custom segments for specific paywall testing scenarios may require extensive custom coding.\\n- **Lack of differentiation for paywall tests**: Firebase does not differentiate between paywall tests and other experiments, potentially leading to challenges in planning, implementing, and analyzing paywall-specific tests.\\n\\nWhile Firebase may excel in general mobile app experience testing, it falls short in meeting the specific needs of paywall A/B testing, requiring additional steps, custom coding, and integration with third-party tools to achieve comprehensive and actionable results. Dedicated solutions like [Adapty](https://adapty.io/paywalls-ab-testing/) are more suitable options for streamlined and effective paywall experimentation.\\n\\n### Myth \\\\#3: A/B tests are difficult to run and complicated to understand\\n\\n![image 9](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-9.jpeg)\\n\\nAnother thing that scares people from even trying A/B testing is complexity. In big companies such experiments are run and analyzed by growth managers or analysts, which makes many app developers think that launching a test and “deciphering” the results is nothing else but secret lore.\\n\\nIn reality, all you need is a basic understanding of [mobile app metrics](https://adapty.io/blog/mobile-app-metrics/) and a convenient platform. For example, launching a paywall A/B test in Adapty takes no more than 5 minutes:\\n\\n- Create a paywall group with 2 paywalls, either with the help of remote config or Paywall Builder.\\n- Choose the placement you want these paywalls to be displayed in.\\n- Select the target audience and choose the traffic weight.\\n- Launch the test and wait for the results.\\n\\n![image 22](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-22.png)_Paywall A/B test launch window in Adapty – pretty minimalistic_\\n\\nFor the more statistically significant results, wait at least 2 weeks before stopping the test (if there’s no definite decline in core metrics, which you can check live in the analytics dashboard). When the experiment is over, the system will show you a detailed report on every paywall’s metrics, including Revenue, ARPPU, Purchases, Trials, Views, Refunds, and many more. But most importantly, you will clearly see which one has the higher **P2BB percentage** (Probability to Be the Best) along with a neat visualization of the experiment timeline.\\n\\n![image 24](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-24.png)_An example of a completed A/B test_\\n\\n### Myth \\\\#4: It takes too much time, effort, and money to make a decent paywall\\n\\n![Mike 1](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mike-1.png)\\n\\nFollowing the default development scheme that’s been used for several years, we have the idea in our heads that every screen in your app must be created by the app designer, or at least made with their approval. Such an approach is important for the app’s consistency but it doesn’t mean that for every paywall A/B test you need to have a new paywall created by your team’s designer – not anymore.\\n\\nWith Adapty’s [Paywall Builder](https://adapty.io/paywall-builder/), marketing or growth specialists, who usually run monetization experiments, can create beautiful paywalls with a native layout in a matter of minutes – with no developer involved. Paywall Builder is a visual no-code editor that enables you to design a paywall based on one of the numerous best-selling templates. Every element on the paywall can then be adjusted to your liking, including images, text font and size, button shape, color scheme, and more.\\n\\n![image 23](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-23.png)\\n\\nA high-quality paywall can actually be created in a few minutes and immediately launched in an A/B test. The same goes for recurring tests: if you’re not satisfied with the results of the previous test, you can apply new changes to the existing paywall pair and relaunch the test, which will also take no more than 5-10 minutes. The future of paywall testing is already here.\\n\\n## Mistakes\\n\\nNow that we’re through with the popular myths, let’s talk about equally common mistakes people tend to make to this day. Along with it, you’ll find out how innovations in the sphere of in-app purchases and monetization can improve the process of paywall A/B testing and solve older problems in a more convenient way.\\n\\n### Mistake \\\\#1: Changing your paywall without running an A/B test\\n\\n![82tjyf](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/82tjyf.jpg)\\n\\nThis may be one of the most common and painful mistakes an app developer or publisher can make. Broken updates are always a loss – both financial and reputational – that’s why we always test new builds before publishing them. For some reason, it’s not always the case with paywalls. A hypothesis may seem so promising that one may not want to waste their time on running a test for a couple of weeks and apply changes to the paywall right away instead.\\n\\nIt may work out, but very often it leads to churn, higher bounce rate, lower conversion rates, and, as a result, a decrease in revenue. Why? Because one could miscalculate things, didn’t pay enough attention to dependencies in the funnel, or still made a technical error that led to troubles with purchases or user flow. Such situations require a quick reaction and swift actions to be taken to restore the previous version of the paywall. But Murphy’s law is still in the game, so you may get into a situation where the follow-up update gets stuck at the store review stage, leaving you to sit and watch your money going down the drain.\\n\\n![82tkzv](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/82tkzv.jpg)\\n\\nShould we say this can never happen when you use Adapty? Primarily for two reasons:\\n\\n1. We recommend running A/B tests for your new paywalls before making them live. Such an approach leaves you with the most profitable paywall at the moment and enables you to test if your new paywall actually works the way you expected it to.\\n2. Even if you decide to apply changes straight away to your live paywall, it’s always easy to go back to the previous variant, thanks to the **remote config** feature. Moreover, if you use the paywalls made with the Paywall Builder, you also reduce the risk of having a technical error to the minimum, since it handles all the coding for you.\\n\\n### Mistake \\\\#2: A/B testing paywalls with too many differences\\n\\n![82tldk](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/82tldk.jpg)\\n\\nOn the one hand, it’s a basic mistake you learn about right before diving into the world of A/B testing, but on the other, it’s a mistake that even experienced growth managers tend to make from time to time.\\n\\n**Important note:** It’s completely normal to test two drastically different paywalls when you intend to test a new paywall template or structure and your only goal is to see that based on your hypothesis the new variant performs at least as well as the older one. In our case, we’re talking about testing several elements within the same template/structure with the hypothesis of increasing this or that conversion rate or some other metric.\\n\\nTo see the most transparent results for any split experiment, you must have the minimum amount of changes in the testing pair. For example, testing only a background picture will give you a more or less accurate result to see which one is more appealing to the users. But testing a background image along with a different product layout and one more new product option will be a mess.\\n\\nI mean, you will get some kind of a result, maybe even a statistically significant one, and perhaps even the test version may win, but you’ll never know what exactly made the users turn to the paywall “B”. Was it a new product, or a new layout? Or maybe just a new picture was enough? It’s fine when your test paywall actually won, but usually, it’s the other way around, so in the end, you’re left with a failed test and don’t even know what happened.\\n\\nI mentioned earlier that even experienced managers tend to abuse this approach, as they feel they already know their product and their audience, but most importantly, they do so because, at some point, **time becomes money**. Product managers of apps with more than $500k MRR may not want to wait for ~2 weeks to test only one element. So sometimes it feels easier and cheaper for them to come up with a more complex hypothesis and test it right away. It may seem rather bold, but the road to success is fraught with risk.\\n\\n### Mistake \\\\#3: Running A/B tests for all users with no targeting\\n\\n![89bahl](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/89bahl.jpg)\\n\\nOnce you’ve learned the beauty of paywall A/B testing, you may find yourself in a situation where you test one and the same paywall over and over for all the users who installed your app. On the one hand, it solves the problem of insufficient traffic, which we’ll talk about a bit later, but on the other hand, it may lead to you receiving less profit than you could from acquiring more high-quality subscribers.\\n\\nTargeting helps set up A/B tests for particular audiences based on a number of factors, like age, region, language, or other custom attributes. Having not only one general paywall but also a few paywalls targeted to certain audiences, may help you find the most profitable subscriber flow that you could run paywall A/B tests on and find the best product-price relationship. Sadly, not every platform that features paywall A/B testing allows for such targeting, but Adapty does. Adapty enables you to show different paywalls to different audiences, distinguished by one or several attributes, and as a result, run separate A/B tests.\\n\\n![image 25](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-25.png)_This is how Adapty shows different paywalls to different audiences_\\n\\n### Mistake \\\\#4: Not using localization and audience segmentation\\n\\n![localized](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/localized.jpg)\\n\\nContinuing the idea of segmentation, it’s worth saying that paywall localization is another vital element that very often gets neglected. In most cases, when creating an app for the Western world, app developers simply leave the interface, along with the paywall, in English to make it more universal for users and easier for themselves. In other cases, they take 5-10 most popular languages and translate the app along with the paywall, either by Google translate or with the help of real translators. And in theory, it should be enough, but only in theory.\\n\\nThere may be a couple of problems here that could actually be depriving you of getting more revenue:\\n\\n- The basic one – **your locale translation either does not fit into the paywall interface or looks overloaded**. It usually happens with German languages which have much longer words. This often gets neglected, as it’s quite difficult to properly check it in advance. So when a user sees such a careless paywall, they may get doubts about the overall quality of your app and may decide to look for something else.\\n- **The paywall doesn’t correlate with the culture you’re aiming at**. It’s usually relevant in the context of Western culture vs Eastern one. Sometimes it’s not enough to simply translate the words, you also need to adapt the paywall to the cultural characteristics of the audience. The least you can do is change the background image, choose a different product layout, and rewrite the benefits with regard to the culture. It doesn’t mean that the paywall with just translation won’t work, but the adapted one is sure to be more appealing and gain you much more.\\n- **Your localized paywall is shown to the wrong audience**. Sometimes you can’t know for sure if your localized paywall converts better or worse for a certain audience. For example, if a localized paywall is shown based on the location, let’s say Mexico, all the users from this location will be shown the Spanish version of the paywall when there’s a large number of native English speakers. Targeting is very important, but not every platform allows you to adjust it.\\n\\nWhy are we talking so much about the localization all of a sudden? Well, because all these problems can be easily solved by A/B testing, especially if you use Adapty.\\n\\nTranslations for your paywall may be added with the help of the aforementioned remote config and adjusted on the fly, which reduces the risk of showing a visually broken paywall. Or if you decide to use the Paywall Builder to create a paywall, you can add new locales right in the editor. Every locale you add is broken down into strings of text for a corresponding paywall element, which makes the localization process much easier. Once the translations are added, **you can preview the localized text** on the mockup of your paywall before publishing it.\\n\\n_Paywall localization and preview in the Paywall Builder_\\n\\nThe same goes for the cultural aspect problem – there’s no faster way to find out which paywall variant works best for a certain culture than A/B testing. Launch a test with two different background images and see if it works. But make sure to aim at the right audience, which is also super convenient with Adapty’s audience targeting. Thanks to its paywall management system, you can set up precise targeting for A/B testing based on many criteria, including region, age, channel, language, etc. So you get both localization and targeted A/B testing in one place – problems solved.\\n\\n### Mistake \\\\#5: Running A/B tests with not enough user traffic\\n\\n![82yh1p](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/82yh1p.jpg)\\n\\nAnother childish mistake comes from actually getting into A/B testing with too much enthusiasm. It’s great to get into experimenting at the early stages of your app growth, but A/B testing of any kind requires as much traffic as possible, which can be a problem at that time.\\n\\nTo get statistically significant results, you need a significant amount of users – it’s that simple. If your user flow is less than 3000-5000 people a month, you risk getting unclear and unreliable results, which may lead you in the wrong direction. There are two ways out of this: EIther postpone A/B testing for a while and wait till your app gets bigger organically or purchase ad traffic. Getting paid ads is one of the most popular User Acquisition strategies, so if your funds allow it – go for it.\\n\\n## To sum it up\\n\\n![image 6](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-6.jpeg)\\n\\nPaywall A/B testing is a safe and efficient way to grow your mobile app, no matter what rumors you may hear. With current technologies, the process of split testing has become much more convenient, affordable, and easy to dive into. If you’ve been putting off tasting app monetization experiments, it’s the best time to start and Adapty is a great choice to use in this journey.

Google App Campaigns playbook 2025: Setup, optimization, reporting & best practices\\n\\nLast updated August 25, 2025\\n\\nby\\n\\n[![](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/cropped-aniruddha-mishra-with-adapty-512x512.jpeg)](https://adapty.io/author/aniruddha-mishra/)\\n\\n[Aniruddha Mishra](https://adapty.io/author/aniruddha-mishra/)\\n\\nPublished May 5, 2025\\n\\nLast updated August 25, 2025\\n\\n10 min read\\n\\n![Cover Google Campaigns Playbook 2025](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/cover-google-app-campaigns-playbook-2025.webp)\\n\\nIn 2025, Google App Campaigns (GAC) (formerly Universal App Campaigns) continues to be a cornerstone for mobile UA growth.\\n\\nWith Google’s AI-driven automation, these campaigns simplify ad placements across Search, Play Store, YouTube, Display, and Discover. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to setting up, optimizing, and scaling your app campaigns effectively.\\n\\nAs of today, April, 2025, it has been approximately 10 years since Google App Campaigns introduction. Yet they continue to remain “black box” because of these three primary reasons:\\n\\n## 1\\\\. **Algorithm-driven automation**\\n\\nGAC is built to **automate everything**:\\n\\n- Ad creatives\\n- Audience targeting\\n- Bidding strategies\\n- Placement decisions\\n\\nThis means **you don’t choose keywords or placements manually** like in traditional Google Ads. Google uses machine learning to optimize based on signals across Google Search, YouTube, Display Network, and Play Store.\\n\\n## 2\\\\. **Limited reporting granularity**\\n\\nGoogle restricts:\\n\\n- **Creative-level performance insights** (you don’t get breakdowns by asset clearly like in Meta)\\n- **Audience data** (you can’t see exact user segments or interest groups)\\n- **Placement data** (you can’t choose or even see full lists of where your ads appear)\\n\\nThis is intentional to preserve the algorithm’s integrity and prevent “over-optimization” by humans, but it creates a **data-blind** experience for marketers.\\n\\nP.S.: Google does allow you to see third-party app placement data based on impressions, but it’s still fairly limited.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. **Google’s incentive: Trust the AI**\\n\\nGoogle wants advertisers to **trust machine learning**, not tweak manually. Their bet is that **aggregated, high-signal user data** is better leveraged by AI than by humans.\\n\\nSo, GAC is designed to **optimize outcomes, not explain them**. And that tradeoff frustrates marketers who want clarity and control.\\n\\nLet’s see how we can tame this black box monster.\\n\\n**A. Campaign setup**\\n\\n![Google App Campaigns interface showing campaign objective options](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1-campaign-goal-selection-screen-1024x492.webp)\\n\\n**Choose the right campaign type**\\n\\nGoogle offers three campaign types for mobile apps:\\n\\n1. **App installs:** Focus on acquiring new users.\\n2. **App engagement:** Re-engage current users (beneficial for inactive or lapsed users).\\n3. **Pre-registration (Android only):** Build hype for upcoming app launches.\\n\\n![Three campaign subtypes in Google App Campaigns: App installs, App engagement (requires 50K installs), and App pre-registration (Android only).](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2-campaign-subtype-selection-screen.webp)\\n\\nAlign campaign types with business goals:\\n\\n1. **For growth**: Start with App Install + “Users likely to perform in-app action.”\\n2. **For monetization:** Use App Installs optimized for in-app purchases.\\n3. **For retention:** Leverage App Engagement with deep links.\\n\\n> _Based on my 11+ years of UA experience and working with Google App Campaigns, I’ve rarely seen install campaigns bringing quality traffic. So I would caution you to stay from Install campaigns._\\n\\nQuestions to ask before launching your Google App Campaigns:\\n\\n1. **What’s the right conversion event to optimize for?**\\n   - Is the event **deep enough** (e.g., `purchase`, not just `install`)?\\n   - Do we get **enough volume** (~30-50/day) for the algorithm to learn?\\n2. **Which bidding strategy makes the most sense?**\\n   - `tCPI` for installs?\\n   - `tCPA` for conversions?\\n   - `tROAS` for revenue?\\n3. **What’s the acceptable cost per event?**\\n   - Based on CAC or payback window?\\n4. **Budget**\\n   - Ensure you keep 50x CPI as the budget for install campaigns\\n   - 10x CPA budget for in-app action campaigns\\n5. **Do you have a robust MMP or Firebase SDK setup?**\\n\\n- Are all in-app events mapped and tested?\\n- Is real-time data being passed to Google?\\n\\n![Google App Campaigns bidding settings screen showing options to focus on](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-Google-App-Campaigns-bidding-options-1024x451.webp)\\n\\n## Why conversion tracking matters in GAC\\n\\nGoogle App Campaigns use conversion data to **train the algorithm**.\\n\\nIf your event data is:\\n\\n- missing,\\n- delayed,\\n- misfiring,\\n- or irrelevant…\\n\\nThe system **won’t know what a “good” user looks like,** and you’ll waste budget attracting low-quality installs.\\n\\n**Core conversion tracking stack**\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Layer** | **Tool** | **Purpose** |\\n| SDK | Firebase or MMP (e.g., Appsflyer, Adjust, Singular) | Track events inside the app |\\n| Ads platform | Google Ads account | Ingest events and optimize based on them |\\n\\n## Google App Campaigns events you MUST track\\n\\nThere are **3 tiers of conversion events**:\\n\\n### ? Tier 1 – Basic\\n\\n- `first_open`\\n- `install`\\n\\n_(Only enough for tCPI bidding, not quality users)_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### ? Tier 2 – Mid-funnel\\n\\n- `sign_up`\\n- `onboarding_complete`\\n- `tutorial_complete`\\n- `login`\\n- `start_trial`\\n\\n_(Better signal for tCPA optimization — 10–50+ per day needed)_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### ? Tier 3 – High-value (End funnel)\\n\\n- `purchase`\\n- `add_to_cart`\\n- `level_complete` (for gaming)\\n- `subscribe`\\n- `renewal`\\n- `add_payment_info`\\n- Custom: `hero_user_achieved` (e.g., completes 3 sessions & spends $10)\\n\\n_(These are ideal for **tROAS** bidding – but you need volume)_\\n\\n## Event mapping between Firebase & Google Ads\\n\\nYou must **import Firebase events** into Google Ads or set up **MMP postbacks**:\\n\\n### Firebase path:\\n\\n1. Link Firebase to Google Ads\\n2. In Google Ads: → Tools > Conversions > Import from Firebase\\n3. Select key events you want to optimize for\\n4. Make sure the event is set as **“primary”** for optimization\\n\\n> ? **Tip:** Use **event parameters** (e.g., revenue value, currency) for ROAS targeting.\\n\\n### MMP path (e.g., Appsflyer, Adjust):\\n\\n- Configure postbacks from MMP to Google Ads\\n- Whitelist Google Ads as an ad partner\\n- Ensure each event is marked with:\\n  - Attribution window (7-day click recommended)\\n  - Postback mode: **all events**, not just attributed ones\\n\\n> ⚠️ Many errors in UA come from misconfigured or delayed postbacks.\\n\\n### Why we recommend Google Firebase for Google App Campaigns (GAC)\\n\\n1. **Audience signals and exclusions** Firebase is the only platform that allows you to create and sync audience segments directly with Google Ads for App Campaigns. This enables precise audience exclusions and targeting signals that are not possible through third-party MMPs.\\n2. **Priority access to betas and features** Google prioritizes Firebase-linked apps when rolling out new features, campaign types, or beta programs. If you’re working with a Google rep, using Firebase significantly increases your chances of being included in early experiments and feature testing.\\n3. **Real-time conversion syncing** Events tracked in Firebase sync directly and instantly with Google Ads, ensuring that your campaigns optimize on the most up-to-date data. This helps improve learning phases and campaign stability compared to delayed MMP postbacks.\\n4. **Seamless Google ecosystem integration** Firebase integrates deeply with the Play Store, Google Analytics, and GA4. This ecosystem-level connection provides a unified view of user behavior from acquisition to post-install engagement, all within Google’s native stack.\\n\\n## Account, campaign & ad group structure\\n\\n### 1\\\\. **At the campaign level**\\n\\nStructure your campaigns based on **platform**, **optimization goal**, and **geo/language grouping**.\\n\\n### A. **Platform: Android vs iOS**\\n\\n- Keep **Android and iOS separate** due to:\\n  - Different user behavior\\n  - Different store ecosystems\\n  - iOS requiring SKAdNetwork support\\n  - Separate event tracking schema\\n\\n**Campaign examples:**\\n\\n- `GAC - Android - Installs - US`\\n- `GAC - iOS - Purchases - UK`\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### B. Optimization goal: Installs vs Actions\\n\\n- Start with **tCPI (Cost per Install)** if you lack event volume\\n- Scale to **tCPA (in-app action)** or **tROAS (revenue)** once you hit ~50+ daily conversions\\n\\nStructure different campaigns by goal:\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Goal** | **Campaign type example** |\\n| Install-focused | `GAC - Android - Installs - Tier 1` |\\n| Purchase-focused | `GAC - Android - Purchases - Tier 1` |\\n| Subscription-focused | `GAC - iOS - Trial Start - US` |\\n\\n> Avoid running different campaigns in the same geo, optimizing for the same event, as this leads to cannibalization.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. At the ad group (asset group) level\\n\\n- Use **one theme per ad group** for clean creative testing (e.g., one for feature-led, one for emotional messaging)\\n- Structure by:\\n  - **Creative concepts** (e.g., utility vs lifestyle)\\n  - **Language variants** (if multi-lingual)\\n  - **Promotion-specific assets** (e.g., holiday offer vs evergreen)\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n\\n- `AG - Value Prop - Track Expenses Fast`\\n- `AG - Promo - 30 Day Free Trial`\\n- `AG - Lifestyle - Gen Z Visuals`\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Pro tips\\n\\n- Limit 1–2 optimization goals per campaign\\n- Don’t overload campaigns with too many asset groups — keep testing structured\\n- Refresh creatives every 2–3 weeks to avoid fatigue\\n- Use naming conventions like: `GAC - Platform - Goal - Geo - Language`\\n\\n## Google App Campaigns creative assets: Full list\\n\\nApp Campaigns use your assets to generate ads across:\\n\\n- Google Search\\n- Google Play\\n- YouTube\\n- Display Network\\n- Discover\\n\\n### Text assets\\n\\n- **Short headline** (max 30 characters) – up to 5\\n- **Description lines** (max 90 characters) – up to 5\\n- **Callouts / Value props** – clear, benefit-focused\\n\\n> ? Best practice: Include different angles (features, emotion, social proof, urgency)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Image assets\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Format** | **Dimensions (in px)** | **Required** |\\n| Square | 1200 × 1200 | ✅ MUST HAVE |\\n| Landscape | 1200 × 628 | ✅ Recommended |\\n| Portrait | 900 × 1600 | ✅ Recommended for YouTube & Discover surfaces |\\n\\n**Max file size**: 150KB (PNG or JPG)\\n\\n**Aspect ratios**:\\n\\n- 1:1 (square)\\n- 1.91:1 (landscape)\\n- 9:16 (portrait)\\n\\n> ?

Ensure your listing:\\n\\n- Is keyword-optimized\\n- Has clear visuals/screenshots\\n- Contains a compelling description and high-quality app icon\\n\\n## Tips & insights from 11+ years of experience running Google App Campaigns\\n\\nAfter managing app growth across industries and budgets for over a decade, here are the core lessons I wish every UA manager, startup, or in-house growth team knew before scaling with Google App Campaigns (GAC):\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 1\\\\. **The algorithm is powerful but only as smart as your signals**\\n\\nGoogle’s automation is unmatched, but it’s not magic. The difference between average and exceptional results comes down to the **quality of your event tracking**.\\n\\n- Set up **custom in-app events** tied to user value (not just installs)\\n- Optimize toward **purchase**, **trial start**, or **deep funnel engagement** once you have sufficient volume\\n- Ensure real-time, deduplicated conversion syncing (Firebase preferred for Google Ads)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 2\\\\. **Structure campaigns to learn, not just to launch**\\n\\nAvoid dumping all assets and countries into a single campaign. Instead, structure for **clarity and control**:\\n\\n- Separate **Android vs iOS**\\n- Separate by **goal** (e.g., Installs, Trial, Purchase, ROAS)\\n- Group countries by **language & monetization similarity**\\n- Limit to **1 theme per asset group** to isolate creative learnings\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 3\\\\. **Creative fatigue happens faster than you think**\\n\\nEven in automated campaigns, poor performance often stems from **creative fatigue**.\\n\\n- Refresh high-volume asset groups every 2–3 weeks.\\n- Track themes (e.g., utility vs emotion vs lifestyle) and rotate across formats (video, static, HTML5)\\n- Watch for “Low” performance labels in asset reporting—and kill them fast\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 4\\\\. **Audience signals can make or break a launch**\\n\\nYou can’t target audiences in Google App Campaigns, but you _can influence them_ via **audience signals** from Firebase. This is one of the most **underutilized levers** in GAC.\\n\\n- Use Firebase to create segments like:\\n  - High LTV users\\n  - Retained 7-day users\\n  - Churned but monetized\\n- Upload those as signals for new campaigns to accelerate learning\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 5\\\\. **Don’t scale until you stabilize**\\n\\nMany marketers scale too fast. That’s when GAC breaks.\\n\\n- Wait for consistent CPAs across 5–7 days\\n- Set your **daily budget = 5–10x your target CPA** (too low = no learning, too high = noisy data)\\n- Scale budgets by **no more than 20% every 48–72 hours** once stable\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 6\\\\. **Use Firebase for access, control, and speed**\\n\\nIf you’re serious about Google App growth:\\n\\n- Firebase gives you **access to audience exclusions**, **conversion event mapping**, and **feature betas**\\n- It integrates deeply with the Google ecosystem and **sends events instantly** (vs. delayed MMP postbacks)\\n- Google reps prioritize Firebase-linked apps for **support and experimentation**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 7\\\\. **Don’t just chase installs. Chase outcomes**\\n\\nThe install volume is a vanity metric. What matters is:\\n\\n- ROAS over 7/14/30 days\\n- Retention and churn\\n- Event velocity (how fast users reach key conversion points)\\n\\n**If your post-install funnel is broken**, no amount of traffic will fix it.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Final word\\n\\nGoogle App Campaigns may seem deceptively simple on the surface, but the brands that truly scale know how to **influence the algorithm**, structure their campaigns intelligently, and evolve quickly.\\n\\nIf you master **creative cadence, signal quality, and campaign discipline**, GAC becomes one of the most efficient levers for app growth.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Tariq](https://adapty.io/author/laibatariq/)\\n\\nPublished December 5, 2023\\n\\nLast updated December 14, 2025\\n\\n9 min read\\n\\n![Developer Options Android](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/developer-options-android.png)\\n\\nAndroid has a secret. We’re letting you in on that…\\n\\nEvery single Android device around you is equipped with a special and hidden setting within the Settings app. It’s called “ [Developer Options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options),” or sometimes Developer Mode.\\n\\nThis side of Android’s setting isn’t for any average Joe because it can tweak and forever alter your device’s behavior, performance, and much more. If you’re an [app developer](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-make-more-money-as-app-developer/) wanting to test out your app performance before launching it, Developer Mode is also where it’s at.\\n\\nSo in this guide, let’s walk you through the magical way of enabling and disabling Developer Options on your Android devices. I’m not kidding; it comes with a specific knock and all!\\n\\nBut for those who are hearing about Developer Mode for the first time today, let’s tackle the basics.\\n\\n## What is Android developer mode?\\n\\nAndroid Developer Mode is a special setting on Android devices that grants users access to a wide range of advanced features and Android developer options, primarily aimed at app developers, tech enthusiasts, and power users.\\n\\nConsider it a backstage pass to your Android device, allowing you to tinker, customize, and optimize your experience in ways not possible in the standard user mode.\\n\\nNow, I know what you’re thinking, “how many developer options can I even have if I enable developer mode?” That was one of my first questions before I got into it myself.\\n\\nSo, here’s an overview of the Android developer options:\\n\\n- **USB Debugging:** Allows you to connect your device to a computer and debug apps, ideal for developers.\\n- **Mock Locations:** Simulate your device’s location for testing location-based apps or services.\\n- **Drawing Stats on Screen:** Visualize how your device’s CPU and GPU are performing in real time.\\n- **OEM Unlocking:** Enables unlocking the bootloader, a prerequisite for flashing custom ROMs.\\n- **Developer Options:** Access various settings and tweaks for customization and performance optimization. Some notable options within Developer Options include:\\n- **Limit Background Processes:** You can restrict the number of background processes to conserve system resources and improve performance.\\n- **Force 4x MSAA (Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing):** Enhances graphics rendering quality, although it may impact performance.\\n- **Show Touches:** Displays visual feedback on the screen when you touch it, which can be useful for creating tutorials or demonstrating app functionality.\\n- **Stay Awake:** Keeps the device’s screen on while it’s charging, which can be handy during development or testing.\\n- **USB Configuration:** Lets you specify how your device behaves when connected to a computer via USB (e.g., file transfer, charging only, etc.).\\n- **Enable Wi-Fi Verbose Logging:** Useful for diagnosing Wi-Fi issues and monitoring network activity in detail.\\n\\nThese are just the key features which means there’s a ton more available when you enable developer options! Now that we know the potential of Android developer options, let’s talk about…\\n\\n### Who needs Android developer mode?\\n\\nWith so many incredible Android developer options hidden right in your setting apps, this mode is particularly useful for:\\n\\n#### App Developers\\n\\nFor those [creating Android apps](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-build-mobile-app-development-team/), Developer Mode provides essential tools for testing and debugging, helping to ensure that their apps run smoothly on a variety of devices.\\n\\n#### Tech Enthusiasts\\n\\nIf you enjoy exploring the inner workings of your Android device, Developer Mode is your gateway to a treasure trove of advanced settings and features. If I’m honest, there’s nothing quite like fiddling around in this mode!\\n\\n#### Power Users\\n\\nUsers who want to take more control of their device’s performance and appearance, optimize battery life, or customize the user interface will know that Developer mode is where it’s at. No matter how you want to alter the workings of your device, Developer Mode will be the efficient way to make it happen.\\n\\n## Do developer options drain phone battery?\\n\\nNo, enabling Developer Options itself does not directly drain the phone battery. However, certain settings within Developer Options, like increased animation scales or background process monitoring, may affect battery life if modified.\\n\\nDeveloper Options are primarily intended for app development and debugging, so keeping them enabled without tweaking settings typically has no noticeable impact on battery consumption.\\n\\n## How to turn on developer options on your Android device?\\n\\nDeveloper Options is quite an exciting concept if you’re a tech-savvy person. So if you’re already jumping on how to enable it, I get you!\\n\\nHere are 6 steps to turn on Developer Mode on your phone within this minute:\\n\\n1. **Open your device’s Settings app.**\\n\\n![image](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-461x1024.jpeg)\\n\\n2. **Scroll down and tap on “About phone” or “About device.”**\\n\\n![image 1](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1-461x1024.jpeg)\\n\\n3. **Tap on the menu item stating, “Software information.”**\\n\\n![image 2](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2-461x1024.jpeg)\\n\\n4. **Find the “Build number” entry and tap on it seven times.** You’ll see a message like “Developer Mode has been enabled,” on a Samsung Galaxy device.\\n\\n![image 3](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3-461x1024.jpeg)\\n\\n![developer options are activated](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-5-461x1024.jpeg)\\n\\n5. **Go back to the main Settings app menu.** You should now see a new menu item called “Developer options” or “System” where you’ll find it.\\n\\n![image 4](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-4-461x1024.jpeg)\\n\\n![image 6](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-6-461x1024.jpeg)\\n\\n6. **Tap on the toggle at the top of Developer Options to turn on Developer Mode on your Android device!**\\n\\nAs soon as your toggle is on, you’ve activated Developer Mode on your Android phone and have access to a range of tech-savvy options. One of the top ones within that developer options menu is USB debugging.\\n\\n## What Is USB Debugging on Android?\\n\\nUSB Debugging mode is a developer mode in Android phones that [allows newly programmed apps to be copied via USB to the device for testing](https://www.samsung.com/in/support/mobile-devices/what-is-usb-debugging-in-samsung-smartphones/). In other words, USB Debugging on Android is like giving your phone a backstage pass to communicate with a computer.\\n\\nWhen you enable USB Debugging, you’re essentially opening up a special channel between your Android device and your computer through a USB cable. This feature is particularly handy for developers and tech enthusiasts because it enables communication for development and troubleshooting purposes.\\n\\nWhen USB Debugging is enabled, it opens up a pathway for your computer to interact with your Android device at a deeper level. This connection is crucial for various tasks related to:\\n\\n- app development,\\n- system debugging, and\\n- Customization.\\n\\nI know what you’re thinking, “how does it do all that?” Let’s talk about them all!\\n\\nOne of the primary use cases for USB Debugging is app development. Imagine you’re a developer working on a new Android app. With USB Debugging, you can connect your phone to your computer and test the app directly on your device. It provides a real-time preview and helps you catch and fix bugs more efficiently than emulators.\\n\\nBeyond app development, USB Debugging plays a crucial role in the world of Android customization. If you’re into installing custom ROMs—alternative versions of the Android operating system—you’ll likely need USB Debugging.\\n\\nThis feature facilitates the smooth transfer of files and commands between your computer and Android device during installation.\\n\\n### Is USB debugging risky?\\n\\nYes, USB debugging can be quite risky if not used appropriately. While USB Debugging is a powerful tool, it comes with potential security risks.\\n\\nEnabling it grants elevated privileges, making your device more susceptible to unauthorized access. When connecting to a new computer, a security dialog box will prompt you to authorize the connection— only grant access to trusted computers!\\n\\n## How to enable the USB Debugging feature?\\n\\nIf you want to enable USB debugging, it’s no tougher than enabling developer mode. In fact, it’s just 2 more added steps to set up the USB debugging feature! If you want to enable the USB debugging feature, you’ll have to enable Developer Mode from the previous steps first.\\n\\nGot that done? Alright, here’s how you enable USB debugging from the Android developer options:\\n\\n1. Open your device’s Settings app. Scroll down and tap on “Developer Mode.”\\n\\n![gDb13wk0mN5xrgSdyWQ4QHEWIFfog9RiQXtFMtNjfJnkHpd3RLb7G7kwvRBtpb7hzG OrwUmQoKHcc3nMx7NNT02v9P9IPNb4d pRrs7skpgISZWzVQqlPoTb5uwcUsc1qu9WIbStJ6nOKB1BHX6B6E](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/gDb13wk0mN5xrgSdyWQ4QHEWIFfog9RiQXtFMtNjfJnkHpd3RLb7G7kwvRBtpb7hzG_OrwUmQoKHcc3nMx7NNT02v9P9IPNb4d-pRrs7skpgISZWzVQqlPoTb5uwcUsc1qu9WIbStJ6nOKB1BHX6B6E)\\n\\n![7Z8Zj2Ht0duSWVak4t6hBM7MMio7zb7TIJm7y0s2E r9wGEzhJB0kRBz10SGQ1dRQaUoHvgLNm8YEvOCtnAmwOSgwGsmO63aTKz wbPffc 8EpxDRDn848wrK2M76E8LhKoUTaCec 3dMIwH ekKoY4](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7Z8Zj2Ht0duSWVak4t6hBM7MMio7zb7TIJm7y0s2E_r9wGEzhJB0kRBz10SGQ1dRQaUoHvgLNm8YEvOCtnAmwOSgwGsmO63aTKz_wbPffc_8EpxDRDn848wrK2M76E8LhKoUTaCec_3dMIwH-ekKoY4)\\n\\n2. In the Developer Options menu, scroll down to find “USB debugging.” Toggle the switch to enable it. And there you have it!\\n\\n![rYtOxEqAisy997eu8FE3PYRRdGD6LpdtttAx4Qw03vi9hKCVBAHYFWSm6YvXnCYPf5e4ISqQVD51A8Uq6gppCY6TX85dvgTZoy00RiKHtd7 QhQuCdB4fdzr0PgfLEXataTguvWnNByKQTCIQWNRAyI](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rYtOxEqAisy997eu8FE3PYRRdGD6LpdtttAx4Qw03vi9hKCVBAHYFWSm6YvXnCYPf5e4ISqQVD51A8Uq6gppCY6TX85dvgTZoy00RiKHtd7-QhQuCdB4fdzr0PgfLEXataTguvWnNByKQTCIQWNRAyI)\\n\\nUpon connecting your device to a computer for the first time with USB Debugging enabled, a security dialog box may appear. It usually asks if you want to allow USB debugging for the connected computer.\\n\\nCheck the box that says “Always allow from this computer” for convenience.\\n\\nIf you don’t have the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed on your computer, you’ll need to install it. You can find the necessary files and instructions on the [official Android developer website](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb).\\n\\nRemember, enabling USB Debugging grants elevated privileges to your device, so be cautious about connecting to unknown computers or allowing debugging access to unfamiliar apps. Always make sure you trust the source before enabling USB Debugging.\\n\\nBefore we move on from this, I also want to bring special attention to one advice. You should only enable USB debugging when you have active use for it. Don’t let it stay on when you don’t need it and disable it whenever it’s not in use.\\n\\nThis brings us to one last question to close this blog for today…\\n\\n## How to disable developer options on Android?\\n\\nDisabling Developer Mode is just as easy as turning it on. Here are 3 quick steps to turn it right off without any hassle:\\n\\n1.

Each one tells part of the story, but on its own, it doesn’t do much.\\n\\nThis is where the North Star metric comes in. Think of it as a central metric that 1) consolidates your data, 2) steers your focus toward growth, and 3) aligns every team effort with your core business goal.\\n\\nSo let’s see what the North Star metric actually is, how it does all of this, and the steps you can follow to identify yours. We’ll also look at its key characteristics and if you can have multiple North Star metrics.\\n\\nHere goes.\\n\\n## What is a North Star metric?\\n\\nLet’s expand on what we just introduced.\\n\\nAs a mobile app business, you likely have multiple analytics solutions as part of your tech stack. While each of these solutions offers valuable insights into specific aspects of your app’s performance, they only provide a fragmented view of your overall performance. For example, with Adapty, you can assess your app’s performance from a revenue perspective, but that’s all.\\n\\nAdditionally, while each metric offered by these analytics solutions—take [Adapty’s reporting on your lifetime value (LTV) metric](https://adapty.io/docs/ltv), for instance—provides a piece of the puzzle on how your app is doing, by themselves, the metrics might not always point to the bigger picture. Said another way, these metrics, though valuable, often operate in isolation and have gaps, making it difficult to understand what truly drives long-term success for your app. Without a unifying metric that helps you make sense of everything that’s going on in your business, it’s challenging to align your teams around what truly matters.\\n\\nEnter: Your **North Star metric**.\\n\\nBy defining a singular, overarching metric that truly reflects your app’s overall performance, you get a clear idea of how you’re doing.\\n\\nIn general, when your North Star metric improves, it should be clear that users are experiencing more of your app’s promised value. This implies that all teams, including design, development, product, marketing, and service, are doing well.\\n\\nBefore we dive into how to identify your app’s North Star metric, let’s first understand the characteristics of a good North Star metric so you’ll know it when you see it. For example, many businesses default to using revenue metrics as their North Star metric—meaning if revenue is going up, everything is going well. But it’s not that simple. Revenue may or may not be a good North Star metric. (We’ll return to this in a later section.)\\n\\n## Characteristics of a good North Star metric\\n\\nThe most important characteristic of a good North Star metric is that it directly reflects the value users get from your app. It captures the core outcome users seek from an app—like better productivity from productivity apps, overall wellbeing from lifestyle apps, or improved fitness from health apps. In other words, it truly aligns with your app’s value proposition.\\n\\nSo your North Star metric should reflect the main promise of your product. To get to this, answer this: _“What’s the single most important thing users come to our app for?”_\\n\\nAvoid picking broad, generic metrics that don’t reflect your app’s unique value proposition (like “total active users” for a niche app).\\n\\nOther than that, a north star metric needs to be:\\n\\n- **Actionable.** It’s important that your team can act on your North Star metric. So avoid metrics that are purely reflective (like lifetime value) without any levers for improvement.\\n- **Predictive.** Your metric should be able to signal future growth or retention and not just be about historical performance. Look for behaviors that predict long-term success. Avoid lagging indicators like churn rate, as they reflect past issues, not opportunities for proactive action.\\n- **Simple and understandable.** Overly complex or multi-layered metrics that confuse stakeholders won’t make good North Star metrics.\\n- **Leading.** Your North Star metric should provide early warning signs of success or failure. Early signals allow for faster intervention. Don’t rely on delayed metrics like lifetime value (LTV) that have long feedback loops, making it difficult to iterate quickly. (This is along the same lines that your North Star metric should be predictive and not reflective.)\\n- **Meaningful.** With your North Star metric, focus on meaningful user behaviors and not vanity surface-level numbers like the “total downloads” or the “number of accounts created.”\\n- **Aligned with company goals.** Ensure your North Star metric aligns with your company’s mission and long-term goals. It should support both user and business success. Don’t choose metrics that look good to stakeholders but don’t actually tie back to the company’s strategic direction.\\n- **Measurable in real time.** Pick a metric that can be tracked and reported in near real-time to enable quick course correction. Avoid metrics that take weeks or months to materialize, like “quarterly retention rate,” which makes it hard to act in the moment.\\n\\nWhile we’re at it, let’s also talk about why you should or shouldn’t use revenue as your North Star metric for your app.\\n\\n### Revenue as a North Star metric…\\n\\nWhile revenue is a clear indicator of your app’s “business” performance, it doesn’t directly measure how well your app is serving its users.\\n\\nIn a lifestyle app, for example, the value users gain—such as health improvements, habit formation, or personal growth—matters more for long-term engagement than immediate financial gain. Focusing on user experience and engagement metrics (e.g., challenges completed, health goals achieved, etc.) is typically a better indicator of success.\\n\\nFocusing on revenue here can push your team to focus on quick monetization strategies, which could actually hurt user engagement.\\n\\nAlso, revenue could be a lagging indicator in many contexts, meaning it shows the outcome of past efforts, but it doesn’t offer insights into how to drive long-term engagement (which would be the key to success for such an app).\\n\\nBesides, as users realize more value from an app, in-app purchases will follow.\\n\\nWith all that out of the way, we can finally see how you can identify your app’s North Star metric.\\n\\n## How to define your North Star metric\\n\\nHere’s how to define your North Star metric.\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Clarify your product’s core value\\n\\nStart by understanding the main benefit your app offers. For example, if you have a lifestyle app focused on mental well-being through daily journaling, your core value might be “helping users improve their mental health by encouraging reflection and mindfulness.” Your North Star metric should directly reflect the value users gain from this core function. In this case, this would be understanding how engaged they are with journaling on a daily basis.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Define your business objectives\\n\\nNext, align the core value you just identified with your business goals. What are you trying to achieve? For example, you may want to increase user engagement, improve retention, or drive subscriptions. If increasing daily engagement is a priority (which it would be in this case), focusing on daily active users—how often people return to the app to engage in journaling or related activities—could be a strong indicator of success.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Analyze user behavior and journeys\\n\\nExamine how users engage with your app. What behaviors indicate that users are benefiting from your core value? In a journaling app, this might involve tracking how often users interact with journal prompts, log their emotions, or reflect on their mental state. Identifying these behaviors will help you pinpoint key touchpoints that matter most to your app’s success. For example, if users who engage with journal prompts every day show higher retention, that could be a valuable indicator of success.\\n\\n### 4\\\\. Identify metrics linked to core value\\n\\nNow, link the behaviors you’ve observed to specific metrics that align with your app’s core value and business goals. For example, for this app, you might focus on metrics such as “daily active users,” “average mood entries per user per day,” or “weekly reflections completed.” Your North Star metric should reflect a behavior that signals long-term engagement and the ongoing value users derive from your app. For this app, “daily active users” could be a perfect North Star metric, indicating consistent and meaningful engagement with the app’s core value of promoting mental well-being.\\n\\n### 5\\\\. Test and validate your metric\\n\\nBefore finalizing your North Star metric, test its effectiveness. Analyze if this metric truly drives business success and aligns with user satisfaction. Try tracking it for a few weeks or months, then measure if it correlates with business outcomes like higher retention or increased subscriptions. If your chosen metric doesn’t fully predict these outcomes, iterate on it.\\n\\n### 6\\\\. Make it a company-wide focus\\n\\nOnce your North Star metric is defined, ensure it’s a focal point for all your teams. Make sure that everyone from product development to marketing understands why this metric is important and how their work contributes to it. Align team goals with the North Star metric to ensure everyone is working towards the same objective: enhancing daily user engagement and supporting mental wellbeing.\\n\\n### 7\\\\. Iterate and refine over time\\n\\nAs your app evolves and your business objectives shift, continue to refine and adjust your North Star metric so it stays relevant. Monitor changes in user behavior and the impact of new features or updates on your North Star. Make adjustments based on real-time data and insights to ensure your metric stays meaningful and effective.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can define a North Star metric that not only aligns with your app’s core value but also drives long-term growth and engagement.\\n\\nAs you can understand, it’s quite an exercise to find your North Star metric, but here’s why it’s important to find one.\\n\\n## Why is finding the North Star metric important?\\n\\nFirst up, it’s not impossible to run a business without a North Star metric, but it’s much more challenging—especially in fast-paced and competitive markets like mobile apps. Finding a North Star metric simplifies decision-making and ensures every team is working toward a common goal. It acts as a filter, helping prioritize features and initiatives that directly impact your success.\\n\\nFor the lifestyle app we’ve been using here, here’s how different teams would align with the daily engagement rate North Star metric:\\n\\nThe **marketing team** would focus on campaigns that attract new users and encourage regular app usage. They might run campaigns around daily reminders, special challenges, or content that promotes the value of journaling, all designed to increase user engagement and return visits.\\n\\nThe **product team** would prioritize features that improve the journaling experience and drive engagement. This could include enhancing the user interface, introducing new types of prompts, or personalizing the journaling experience to keep users coming back daily. They would work closely with data to understand which features keep users engaged and how to refine them further.\\n\\nFor the **revenue team**, the focus would be on finding ways to monetize that engagement. Since engagement is a key driver of retention and satisfaction, they could look into introducing premium features, like personalized journaling insights or exclusive content, as upsells to a free app. They would track how these premium offerings align with increased user engagement and measure their impact on subscription rates or in-app purchases.\\n\\nBy aligning these teams with a single North Star metric (daily engagement rate), all efforts—whether attracting new users, improving the product, or monetizing the app—are channeled toward the shared goal of increasing user interaction. This unified focus ensures the app’s growth and long-term success, providing clear direction for each department and making decision-making more streamlined and effective.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, let’s explore the idea of using multiple North Star metrics.\\n\\n## Can you have multiple North Star metrics for your app?\\n\\nYes, you could have multiple North Star metrics, but you’ll still have a “star” North Star metric.\\n\\nThe key to managing multiple North Star metrics is to ensure alignment of your secondary North Star metrics with your main or overarching North Star metric. A secondary North Star metric could also be loosely called a particular business area’s “One Metric That Matters” (OMTM). Multiple areas would translate to multiple North Star metrics in this sense.\\n\\nImagine a pyramid to understand how this works.\\n\\nAt the very top, you have your “business” North Star metric. This serves as the overarching guiding light for the entire company’s strategic direction. It’s the one metric everyone rallies behind.\\n\\nJust below it, you define supporting North Star metrics for your key teams or product areas. Each team’s metric contributes to the success of the primary business metric while focusing on specific areas that they control.\\n\\nThis is how it would look for our app:\\n\\n**Primary business North Star:**“Daily active users who complete at least one journaling session” (captures user engagement with the core app feature of daily journaling).\\n\\n**Supporting North Star metrics:**\\n\\n- **Product team:** “Daily active users who complete at least one journal prompt” (focuses on engagement with the app’s core journaling feature—yes, this is also the primary business North Star!)\\n- **Growth team:** “Weekly cohort retention rate” (tracks how well users are retained after their first journaling session or interaction with the app).\\n- **Revenue team:** “Subscription conversion rate” or “Average revenue per user (ARPU)” (measures progress towards monetization and recurring revenue growth).\\n\\nThis approach allows each team to focus on a critical part of the app’s success while keeping everyone aligned toward the broader business goal. The product team might prioritize building better challenges, while the growth team improves onboarding flows, and the revenue team focuses on upgrading free users to paid plans.\\n\\nBy organizing North Star metrics in a pyramid, you ensure alignment, accountability, and clarity at every level of the company. This structure also makes it easier to measure how each team’s efforts contribute to the overall mission.\\n\\n## Wrapping it up…\\n\\nIn summary, growing your mobile app requires more than just data—it requires clarity and focus. Your North Star Metric offers exactly that: a guiding metric that unifies your data and directs your teams’ efforts toward a single shared objective.\\n\\nBy concentrating on this one central metric, you can eliminate distractions and ensure that every team, from product development to marketing and customer support, works in alignment with your app’s core purpose.\\n\\nNow that you know how to find your North Star Metric, it’s time to act. Start by identifying the core value your app delivers to users. Determine how this ties to your primary business goal and pick your North Star metric. Finally, align your teams around this vision!\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Adapty hosted the webinar as part of the series on mobile app monetization strategies._ [_Watch the webinar recording_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uew1WGc4PWk) _on our YouTube channel._\\n\\nPicture this: Bill downloads your app, excited to try it out. Within 15 seconds, he’s bombarded with permission requests — ATT prompt, privacy policy, push notifications, location access, camera access, contacts. Bill’s face goes from curious to annoyed. He deletes your app after one session.\\n\\n![Bills Face](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Bills-face.webp)\\n\\nIf this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. According to recent data, 53% of apps get uninstalled within 30 days of download, and 45% of those deletions happen within the first 24 hours. The culprit? Poor user onboarding.\\n\\nI’ve spent years working with mobile apps at Replug, and I’ve seen this pattern repeat endlessly. The thing is, most app developers know onboarding matters. But knowing and executing are two different games entirely. So let me walk you through what actually works — not theory, but patterns I’ve seen succeed across dozens of apps.\\n\\n## **Why user onboarding matters**\\n\\nThree forces have converged to make [onboarding](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/) more critical than ever:\\n\\n**Users are ignorant.** Not in a pejorative sense — they simply don’t understand how your app works. They download it with a vague idea and expect immediate clarity. You have seconds, not minutes, to make things click.\\n\\n**Privacy requirements have exploded.** ATT on iOS, upcoming changes on Android, GDPR in Europe. Every platform now demands explicit permission for everything. These interruptions fracture the user experience unless you design around them intentionally.\\n\\n**Monetization can’t wait.** You need revenue to keep building. The old approach of “let them use it for weeks, then ask for money” doesn’t work in competitive markets. Onboarding has become your first real monetization opportunity.\\n\\n## **What good onboarding actually achieves**\\n\\nLet’s break down the concrete benefits, divided into product and marketing perspectives:\\n\\n### **Product benefits**\\n\\n**1\\\\. Welcome your users**\\n\\nThis seems obvious, but most apps skip it entirely. A simple “Thanks for choosing us” page sets the tone. When [PhotoSì](https://www.photosi.com/en/) says “Lovely to see you — welcome to your treasure chest of memories,” it’s cheesy, sure. But it works. You’re establishing warmth before making demands.\\n\\n![Image 11](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/image-11.png)\\n\\n**2\\\\. Explain your core features**\\n\\nOne of our clients had a feature that made users incredibly sticky once they tried it. We added one onboarding screen explaining this feature. Now, the users wanted to try it and knew where to find it.\\n\\n![Explain Your Core Features 1](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Explain-your-core-features-1.webp)\\n\\nIf something is crucial to your value proposition, show it early. Don’t assume users will discover it organically.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Prevent uninstalls and limit one-session users**\\n\\nWhen users understand what they downloaded and feel welcomed, they stick around. Apps with [structured onboarding](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-fix-your-onboarding-flow/) see significantly lower day-1 churn.\\n\\n![Prevent Uninstalls And Limit One Session Users](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Prevent-uninstalls-and-limit-one-session-users.webp)\\n\\n### **Marketing benefits**\\n\\n**4\\\\. Request permissions intelligently**\\n\\nHere’s where pre-authorization screens become your best friend. Instead of immediately showing Apple’s ATT prompt, show your own screen first explaining what IDFA tracking means and why accepting benefits them.\\n\\n![Request Permissions Intelligently](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Request-permissions-intelligently.webp)\\n\\nAdidas [Runtastic](https://www.runtastic.com/) nailed this. They literally explained the technical concept of IDFA before asking for permission. This approach:\\n\\n- Creates awareness and knowledge\\n- Gives you a chance to explain the “what’s in it for me”\\n- Lets users who will say “no” skip without triggering the official prompt (which you can only show once)\\n\\n**5\\\\. Increase push notification opt-in**\\n\\nRoughly 50% of users decline push notifications on iOS. That means you can’t reach half your audience with updates, offers, or engagement nudges. Pre-permission screens significantly improve these numbers.\\n\\n[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/get-the-app) uses a simple visual: “Stay up to date — enable push notifications to receive updates from The Economist.”\\n\\n![Increase Push Notification Opt In](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Increase-push-notification-opt-in.webp)\\n\\nThe app offers a “skip” option. If users skip, you don’t show the official prompt yet — you wait for a better moment. For a delivery app, that’s when they place their first order. For a news app, it’s after they read their first article.\\n\\n**6\\\\. Collect user preferences and registration**\\n\\nWhen you know what users care about, you can personalize everything — their feed, your push notifications, your email campaigns, your product recommendations.\\n\\n[Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/) asks what type of books you like and what you want to learn about. E-commerce or fashion apps can ask about favorite brands and sizes. All this can be used for future communication. One clever trick: after users spend time selecting preferences, present the account creation page with “Sign up to save your interests.” It’s a small nudge that converts remarkably well.\\n\\n![Collect User Preferences And Registration](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Collect-user-preferences-and-registration.webp)\\n\\n**7\\\\. Create immediate monetization windows**\\n\\nSubscription apps increasingly show paywalls during onboarding — often after explaining value but before full app access. This isn’t aggressive; it’s strategic. You’re creating a moment where the user understands what they’re getting and can make an informed decision about upgrading.\\n\\n![Create Immediate Monetization Windows](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Create-immediate-monetization-windows.webp)\\n\\nThe paywall placement varies by app type, but the principle holds: monetization conversations start early now, not after weeks of free use. Check out this article to learn more about [different types of paywalls](https://adapty.io/blog/the-10-types-of-mobile-app-paywalls/).\\n\\n## **Real app onboarding examples: Bad to good**\\n\\n### **The bad: permission overload**\\n\\nI downloaded an app recently that immediately hit me with:\\n\\n- Location permission request\\n- Push notification opt-in\\n- Privacy policy acceptance screen\\n- ATT prompt\\n\\n![Permission Overload](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/permission-overload.webp)\\n\\nAll within 15 seconds. Don’t do this. Your users aren’t prepared, they don’t understand why you need these permissions, and you’re burning through one-time prompts before establishing any value.\\n\\n### **The good: Blinkist**\\n\\nBlinkist’s onboarding is a masterclass:\\n\\n![Blinkists Onboarding Is A Masterclass](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Blinkists-onboarding-is-a-masterclass.webp)\\n\\n1. **Welcome page:** “Understand powerful ideas in 15 minutes” with visuals of their best books\\n2. **Use cases:** Shows when you can use the app (while driving, running, waiting)\\n3. **Preference collection:** What topics interest you? What categories? (Using a Tinder-style swipe interface for book selection)\\n4. **Push notification request:** Pre-permission screen saying “Don’t miss out on what’s new”\\n5. **Registration:** Only after establishing value\\n\\nEach step builds on the previous one. By the time they ask for permissions or registration, you understand the app and want to say yes.\\n\\n### **The good: hvv switch (Hamburg mobility app)**\\n\\n[hvv switch](https://hvv-switch.de/en/) impressed me with their honest approach:\\n\\n![Hvv Switch Impressed Me With Their Honest Approach](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/hvv-switch-impressed-me-with-their-honest-approach.webp)\\n\\n- **Welcome page:** “One app, all destinations”\\n- **Privacy + ATT:** Pre-permission screen that says “Help us — we’d like to use digital ads to draw the attention of other Hamburg residents to our app.” They’re explicitly appealing to local pride\\n- **Account creation:** Clear value proposition for why you need an account\\n- **Location permission:** Pre-screen explaining “See vehicles around you”\\n\\nHonesty works. They’re not hiding what they need or why. Users appreciate transparency.\\n\\n### **The good: Paired (relationship app)**\\n\\nPaired combines monetization with preference collection brilliantly:\\n\\n![Paicombines Monetization With Preference Collection Brilliantly](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Paired-combines-monetization-with-preference-collection-brilliantly.webp)\\n\\n1. Welcome with three value propositions\\n2. Immediate account creation (essential for their use case)\\n3. Newsletter opt-in\\n4. ATT request with pre-screen\\n5. Personal information collection\\n6. Push notification request: “Notifications from your partner — you don’t want to miss those”\\n7. **Paywall with transparent trial:** “7-day free trial. In 5 days we’ll remind you. In 7 days you’ll be charged.”\\n\\nThat last point is crucial. The best paywalls don’t feel sneaky. They clearly explain when charges happen.\\n\\n## **The 37% improvement that changed everything**\\n\\nOne of our clients ran a paid acquisition campaign with terrible trial conversion rates. Users were downloading but not starting trials. We analyzed their onboarding and found several issues:\\n\\n- Visually unappealing registration page\\n- Unclear value proposition\\n- Confusing permission requests\\n\\n![The 37 Improvement That Changed Everything](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/The-37-improvement-that-changed-everything.webp)\\n\\nWe redesigned the onboarding with:\\n\\n- Clear welcome screen with value props\\n- Simplified registration\\n- Well-designed paywall emphasizing “Don’t miss calls ever again — start your 30-day free trial”\\n- Streamlined permission requests with context\\n\\n![Weesigned The Onboarding](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/We-redesigned-the-onboarding.webp)\\n\\n**Result: 37% increase in trial start rate.** More downloads converted to trials, which meant more opportunities for users to experience the product and convert to paid.\\n\\n**What you should do**\\n\\nBased on hundreds of apps I’ve analyzed, here’s what consistently works:\\n\\n**Be polite and welcoming.** Your users chose you among competitors. Show gratitude.\\n\\n**Always specify “what’s in it for me.”** Every request should come with a clear user benefit. Don’t just ask for push notifications — explain what valuable information they’ll receive.\\n\\n**Use pre-permission screens religiously.** This is especially critical for ATT, push notifications, and review requests. Pre-screens let you:\\n\\n- Explain why you need the permission\\n- Filter out users who will say no (preserving your one-time official prompt)\\n- Choose better moments to ask again\\n\\n**Consider contextual onboarding.** Guide users through your app as they use it, rather than explaining everything upfront.\\n\\n**Give users control.** Always offer a “skip” or “maybe later” option. Users want to feel in control, even if you prefer they complete every step.\\n\\n**Add a paywall to create immediate monetization opportunities.** Don’t be shy about this — if you’ve explained value well, asking for money makes sense.\\n\\n**Create a seamless experience.** Onboarding isn’t separate screens duct-taped together. It’s one cohesive journey from download to active use.\\n\\n## **What you should avoid** **in app onboarding**\\n\\n**Don’t show multiple permission prompts back-to-back.** Space them out. Provide context. Never bombard users in the first 15 seconds.\\n\\n**Don’t be overly formal.** Onboarding is your chance to show personality. Use your actual brand voice, not corporate speak.\\n\\n**Don’t treat all requests equally.** Prioritize based on your app type. A weather app absolutely needs location. A news app can ask for that later (or never).\\n\\n**Don’t forget users who say “no” to pre-screens.** They declined in that moment, not forever. Find better moments to ask — like when they’re actually using the feature that needs that permission.\\n\\n**Don’t assume — test everything.** Gaming apps need different onboarding than fitness apps. Subscription apps differ from e-commerce apps. What works for one app may fail for another. Test your assumptions.\\n\\n## **Why Bill matters**\\n\\nRemember Bill from the beginning? That story matters because every day, thousands of users have Bill’s experience with apps. They download something promising, get overwhelmed by demands, and delete.\\n\\nYour job is to guide users from curiosity to comprehension to commitment. Onboarding is where that journey begins.\\n\\nGet this right, and you’ll see better retention, higher monetization, more permissions granted, and ultimately, sustainable growth. Get it wrong, and well — Bill deletes your app, and you never get a second chance.\\n\\n[![Onboarding Blbanner](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/11/Onboarding_blog-banner-1024x286.webp)](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/?utm_campaign=29683057-GTM%20%7C%20Onboarding%20Builder&utm_source=blog&utm_content=why-45-of-users-delete-your-app)\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

It is an easy way to lose trust.\\n\\nThat’s exactly why the “ **Restore purchase”** exists. It might seem like an optional button, but it’s a must, especially for subscription-based apps.\\n\\nThis option lets users regain access to previously purchased content without paying again.\\n\\nIt’s a small button with a big role in trust, compliance, and user retention.\\n\\n## Why it matters\\n\\n- **User trust**: If someone paid once, they expect to keep access, no matter the device.\\n\\n- **Support load**: Confusing or missing restore logic = angry users + more tickets.\\n\\n- **App Store compliance**: Apple and Google both expect you to include a restore option for certain product types.\\n\\n## What purchases can be restored\\n\\n**Restorable purchases include**:\\n\\n- **Non-consumables**: One-time purchases like lifetime access or premium features.\\n\\n- **Auto-renewable subscriptions**: Monthly/yearly plans that sync across devices.\\n\\n- **Non-renewing subscriptions**: Fixed-term access (e.g., a 3-month pass).\\n\\n**Not restorable**:\\n\\n- **Consumables** like coins, extra lives, or one-time boosts. These are meant to be used up.\\n\\n## How the “Restore purchase” button works\\n\\n1. **UI/UX.** Add a **“Restore purchase”** button — usually in the settings or directly on the paywall.\\n\\n2. **Trigger.** On tap, trigger a restore via:\\n\\n\\n   - **SKPaymentQueue.restoreCompletedTransactions()** for iOS\\n\\n   - **BillingClient.queryPurchaseHistoryAsync()** for Android\\n\\n   - Or your backend logic if you manage entitlements server-side\\n3. **Update access.** After restore completes, refresh the user’s subscription status and unlock content.\\n\\n4. **Add a helpful copy.** A simple line helps reduce confusion: _“Use this if you’ve switched devices or reinstalled the app.”_\\n5. **Avoid redundancy.** If the user already has access, disable the button or hide it entirely.\\n\\n6. **Account logic.** For apps with login: tie subscriptions to user accounts and sync via backend to simplify cross-device restoration.\\n\\n## How restoring purchases works on iOS\\n\\nOn iOS, restoring purchases refreshes the app receipt and re-delivers products tied to the user’s Apple ID. The process runs quietly in the background, and the experience should feel simple and clear.\\n\\nHere’s how to do it using native StoreKit (pre‑StoreKit 2):\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Start the restore process\\n\\nCall **restoreCompletedTransactions()** to trigger the restore flow:\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| SKPaymentQueue.default().restoreCompletedTransactions() |\\n\\nThis tells StoreKit to look for any past purchases tied to the current Apple ID.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Handle the restored transactions\\n\\nListen to the payment queue and check for **.restored** transaction states. Then, unlock content and mark the transaction as finished:\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| func paymentQueue(\\\\_ queue: SKPaymentQueue, updatedTransactions transactions: \\\\[SKPaymentTransaction\\\\]) {<br>    for transaction in transactions {<br>        if transaction.transactionState == .restored {<br>            // Unlock access based on restored product<br>            unlockContent(transaction: transaction)<br>            SKPaymentQueue.default().finishTransaction(transaction)<br>        }<br>    }<br>} |\\n\\nDon’t forget to call **finishTransaction(\\\\_:)**. Otherwise, StoreKit may continue to retry the same transaction.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Handle failures gracefully\\n\\nRestore may fail due to invalid receipts, network issues, or if the Apple ID has no eligible purchases. Show clear feedback to users and log the error for debugging.\\n\\nUsing **Adapty SDK**? We handle all of this, including receipt validation and edge cases, with a single method call.\\n\\n## How restoring purchases works on Android\\n\\nOn Android, restoring purchases means checking the user’s purchase history via Google Play and reactivating any non-consumable products or active subscriptions. There’s no built-in “restore” button like on iOS. That means you handle it manually through the billing API.\\n\\nHere’s how to do it using the Google Play Billing Library:\\n\\n### **1\\\\. Query purchase history**\\n\\nUse **queryPurchaseHistoryAsync()** to fetch the user’s past purchases:\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| billingClient.queryPurchaseHistoryAsync(<br>    BillingClient.SkuType.SUBS<br>) { billingResult, purchaseHistoryList -><br>    if (billingResult.responseCode == BillingClient.BillingResponseCode.OK && purchaseHistoryList != null) {<br>        for (purchase in purchaseHistoryList) {<br>            // Restore subscription access<br>            restoreEntitlement(purchase)<br>        }<br>    }<br>} |\\n\\nYou can also query in-app purchases by passing BillingClient.SkuType.INAPP.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Validate & unlock\\n\\nAfter retrieving the purchase history, validate receipts (ideally server-side), and grant access accordingly. Be sure to verify signature data to prevent spoofing.\\n\\nAdapty handles purchase validation, user access logic, and cross-platform syncing out of the box.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. UX considerations\\n\\nSince Android users don’t expect a “Restore Purchases” button, you can:\\n\\n- Trigger restoration automatically on login or app launch\\n\\n- Or offer a discreet option under Settings for transparency\\n\\nEither way, make sure the restore logic runs silently in the background and updates the UI when access is restored.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nThe “Restore purchase” button may look simple, but it plays a critical role in the subscription journey.\\n\\n- It builds trust.\\n- It reduces churn.\\n- It keeps you compliant.\\n\\nMake it visible. Make it work. And make it easy to understand.\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### Do I need to show the “Restore purchase” button even if I use sign-in?\\n\\nIf your app uses sign-in as the only way to access purchases, the button may not be technically required. But Apple still recommends it, and it helps reduce support requests.\\n\\n### Does restore trigger a refund?\\n\\nNo. It only reactivates valid past purchases; no charges are involved.\\n\\n### Should I call for “Restore purchase” automatically on every app launch?\\n\\nNo. It’s typically triggered manually by the user. But if you use Adapty or your own backend, you can sync purchases silently on app start to ensure access is always up to date.\\n\\n### Does restoring purchase work without login?\\n\\nOn iOS — yes, if the same Apple ID is used. On Android, login is recommended to link purchases to a persistent user account.\\n\\n### Can users restore purchases if they change their Apple ID or Google account?\\n\\nNo. “Restore purchase” works only for the account that originally made the purchase.\\n\\n### How does “Restore purchase” work with Family Sharing?\\n\\nOn iOS, if the product supports Family Sharing and it’s enabled, any family member can restore the purchase. Behavior depends on App Store settings and product type.\\n\\n### What happens if “Restore Purchase” finds no purchases?\\n\\nShow a friendly message like: _“No previous purchases found for your account.”_ It prevents confusion and confirms the process ran as expected.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Ads](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/How-to-analyze-and-optimize-Apple-Ads.webp)\\n\\n_**TL;DR:** Effective Apple Ads analysis starts with proper attribution setup to track subscription revenue, not just downloads. Use Share of Voice analysis to identify scaling opportunities, segment users by acquisition keywords for personalized experiences, and focus on ROAS metrics rather than vanity metrics. Key optimization tactics include dynamic keyword discovery, bid optimization based on impression share, and Custom Product Pages matched to search intent._\\n\\nApple Ads delivers 60%+ conversion rates, but most subscription apps struggle to scale profitably because they focus on the wrong metrics and lack proper analysis frameworks. The difference between successful campaigns and budget drains comes down to analyzing the right data and optimizing for subscription revenue, not just installs.\\n\\nMost advertisers are optimizing for the wrong outcomes. They’re focused on downloads while their actual business runs on subscriptions. It’s like judging a restaurant by how many people walk through the door instead of how much they spend on dinner.\\n\\nIn this guide based on insights from our recent webinar, we’ll walk through how to set up proper analysis infrastructure and the optimization strategies that actually move the needle for subscription apps.\\n\\n## What makes Apple Ads different for subscription apps?\\n\\nBefore diving into analysis techniques, you need to understand why [Apple Ads](https://adapty.io/blog/apple-search-ads/) requires a completely different analytical approach than other channels.\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Attribution without App Tracking Transparency headaches\\n\\nHere’s the critical advantage most people miss: Apple Ads attribution doesn’t rely on App Tracking Transparency prompts or SKAdNetwork setup. This means you can track deep conversion events, like subscription activations, renewal rates, and lifetime value, with complete confidence in your attribution data.\\n\\nFor subscription apps with complex conversion funnels, this changes everything. You can accurately measure not just who downloaded your app, but who completed onboarding, started trials, converted to paid subscriptions, and remained active months later.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. High-intent users require different analysis\\n\\nApple Ads reaches people actively searching for solutions in the App Store. With over 600 million weekly active users, you’re accessing them at the moment they’re most likely to download an app. This high-intent traffic converts differently than social media or display traffic, requiring specialized analysis approaches.\\n\\n## How to set up proper Apple Search Ads analysis?\\n\\nEffective analysis starts with the right campaign structure and attribution setup. Without these fundamentals, you’ll be optimizing based on incomplete or misleading data.\\n\\n### Essential campaign structure for clean analysis\\n\\nThe recommended structure for subscription apps includes:\\n\\n- **Brand defense campaign** → targeting your app name and branded terms.\\n- **Competitor campaign** → targeting competitor app names and branded keywords.\\n- **Generic terms campaign** → targeting category and feature-related keywords.\\n- **Discovery campaign** → using Apple’s Search Match algorithm to find new keywords.\\n\\n**Key insight from our webinar:** Treat your Discovery Campaign as a keyword research engine, not a permanent acquisition channel. Set lower bids and budgets for Discovery, then migrate proven keywords to dedicated campaigns with higher budgets.\\n\\nThis approach prevents the classic mistake of letting Discovery campaigns eat your budget on irrelevant traffic while starving your proven keywords of investment.\\n\\n## How do I track subscription revenue from Apple Ads?\\n\\nFor subscription apps, you need to track beyond downloads to subscription revenue. With Adapty, you can integrate Apple Ads attribution with just a few clicks through the AdServices framework, no MMP required. This integration allows you to analyze:\\n\\n- Revenue and MRR by keyword and campaign\\n- ARPU by acquisition source\\n- LTV calculations in real-time\\n- Cohort analysis showing user behavior over time\\n- Subscription conversion rates at different intervals\\n\\n![Apple Ads dashboard displaying organized campaign structure with Brand, Competitor, Generic, and Discovery campaigns for two apps across US and Japan markets, each with $12.50 daily budgets and zero spend/revenue indicating fresh campaign launches](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2022/12/Adapty_ads_manager_all_campaign_groups-1024x752.webp)\\n\\n**Pro tip:** Most attribution setups focus on first-session events. For subscription apps, you need to track the entire user journey from download to renewal, sometimes spanning months.\\n\\n## What Apple Search Ads metrics should I analyze?\\n\\n[Most Apple Ads advice](https://adapty.io/blog/apple-ads-best-practices/) focuses on vanity metrics that don’t correlate with business success. Here’s what actually drives profitable growth.\\n\\n### Focus on revenue metrics\\n\\nROAS is everything. Not CPC, not installs, not tap-through rates. Only ROAS tells you whether campaigns generate profitable growth.\\n\\n**Key metrics to track:**\\n\\n- Cost per subscriber (not just cost per install)\\n- LTV:CAC ratio by keyword cluster\\n- Subscription conversion rate by acquisition source\\n- Revenue attribution down to the keyword level\\n- Churn patterns by traffic source\\n\\nThink about it this way: Would you rather have 1,000 downloads that generate $500 in revenue, or 100 downloads that generate $2,000? The math is obvious, but most campaign optimization completely ignores it.\\n\\n### Share of Voice analysis for scaling opportunities\\n\\nOne of the most powerful but overlooked metrics is impression share by keyword. Apple reports this in ranges (like 90-100%), and understanding these ranges reveals scaling opportunities most advertisers miss.\\n\\n**The 90% rule →** if you have 90-100% impression share for a well-performing keyword, you’ve maximized that keyword’s potential. Focus additional budget on new keywords rather than increasing bids further.\\n\\n**Budget vs Bid analysis:**\\n\\n- Low impression share + not spending full budget = increase bids\\n- Low impression share + spending full budget = increase daily budget\\n- High impression share + good performance = test lowering bids to free up budget\\n\\nThis framework prevents the common mistake of endlessly bidding up on keywords you’ve already maximized, while missing opportunities to expand your reach.\\n\\n## How do I know which keywords drive high-value subscribers?\\n\\nKeyword analysis goes beyond basic performance metrics to understand user intent and conversion patterns, the secret to sustainable scaling.\\n\\n### User segmentation by acquisition keywords\\n\\nNot all downloads convert equally. Users searching for “free fitness app” have completely different intentions than those searching for “personal trainer app.”\\n\\n**Create intent-based segments:**\\n\\n- Price-sensitive users: “free app,” “cheap app” keywords\\n- Feature-focused users: “calorie counter,” “workout tracker” keywords\\n- Premium users: “professional app,” “premium features” keywords\\n\\n**Analyze each segments:**\\n\\n- Subscription conversion rates\\n- Time to first payment\\n- Lifetime value\\n- Churn patterns\\n\\nThis segmentation reveals why some keywords that look expensive deliver your highest-value customers, while “cheap” keywords might be bleeding money through high churn rates.\\n\\n### Dynamic keyword discovery analysis\\n\\nTo maximize the effectiveness of your Discovery campaign, implement what we call a dynamic pipeline where:\\n\\n1. The Discovery campaign is assigned lower bids and lower daily budgets than other campaigns.\\n2. Once keywords in the Discovery campaign prove efficient (measured by conversion rate), add them as negative keywords in the Discovery campaign.\\n3. Add the proven keyword to relevant campaigns in exact match targeting with higher budgets and bids.\\n4. This allows the Discovery campaign to continue finding new keywords while your proven keywords scale in dedicated campaigns.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that performing keywords can scale with higher budgets while your Discovery Campaign continues to find new opportunities.\\n\\n### Seasonal and competitive analysis\\n\\nMonitor keyword performance patterns to identify:\\n\\n- **Seasonal opportunities:** fitness spikes in January, educational apps before school seasons\\n- **Competitive budget cycles:** cost drops when competitors hit monthly/quarterly limits\\n- **Market timing:** increased search volume around industry events or trends\\n\\nUnderstanding these patterns lets you capitalize on opportunities while competitors are asleep at the wheel.\\n\\n## When should I increase vs. decrease my Apple Ads bids?\\n\\nAnalysis is only valuable if it leads to actionable optimizations. Here’s how to turn insights into improved performance.\\n\\n### Bid optimization based on auction analysis\\n\\nApple’s auction system factors in tap-through rates, not just bid amounts. Since Apple gets paid per tap, they consider expected revenue when determining winners.\\n\\n**Optimization strategies:**\\n\\n- Improve tap-through rates through Custom Product Pages to win auctions at lower bids\\n- Test minimum effective bids for high-impression-share keywords to free up budget\\n- Increase bids strategically based on Share of Voice gaps, not daily performance fluctuations\\n\\nMost advertisers bid emotionally based on yesterday’s spend. Smart advertisers bid strategically based on auction dynamics and long-term profitability.\\n\\n### Campaign structure optimization\\n\\nAs campaigns mature, evolve your structure based on performance data:\\n\\n- **Level 1:** Basic keyword grouping by theme\\n- **Level 2:** Separate high-ARPU keywords into dedicated campaigns\\n- **Level 3:** Individual campaigns for best-performing keywords with Custom Product Pages\\n\\nThis progression ensures you’re not over-engineering from day one, but you’re also not stuck with a structure that limits your scaling potential.\\n\\n### Personalization based on keyword analysis\\n\\nUse keyword data to create personalized experiences:\\n\\n- **Custom Product Pages:** Match landing page content to keyword intent (sports keywords see sports features, meditation keywords see mindfulness content)\\n- **Segmented paywalls:** Show different subscription offers based on acquisition keywords — weight loss keywords see fitness-focused pricing, productivity keywords see business-plan options\\n\\n![Side-by-side mobile screenshots showing how the same fitness app personalizes its subscription page based on keyword intent - weight loss focus with purple branding on left, muscle building focus with blue branding on right, demonstrating keyword-based personalization strategy.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/adapty-apple-ads-1024x515.webp)\\n\\n- **Targeted push notifications**: Send keyword-specific messages using the same language that drove acquisition\\n\\nThis level of personalization can improve conversion rates by 20-40% compared to generic experiences.\\n\\n## Are my brand campaigns just stealing organic downloads?\\n\\nBrand defense campaigns often show great metrics but may just be capturing organic traffic. Here’s how to measure true impact:\\n\\n### Calculating Cost Per Protected Install\\n\\n1. Pause brand campaigns for 1-2 weeks (if possible).\\n2. Monitor organic download changes during the pause.\\n3. Calculate protected installs (downloads lost when pausing).\\n4. Calculate cannibalized installs (downloads that continued organically).\\n5. Determine true cost per protected install.\\n\\nThis analysis often reveals that brand defense is less efficient than it appears, freeing up budget for growth-focused campaigns.\\n\\n### Competitive timing analysis\\n\\nMonitor competitors’ budget patterns to find opportunities:\\n\\n- End-of-month cost drops when competitors hit budget limits.\\n- Seasonal competition changes around industry events.\\n- Impression share increases during competitor budget gaps.\\n\\nSmart timing can reduce your CPCs by 20-30% during these windows.\\n\\n## How do top performers scale their Apple Search Ads?\\n\\nOnce you have solid analysis infrastructure, these advanced techniques can significantly improve performance.\\n\\n### AI-powered keyword discovery\\n\\nBeyond traditional keyword research, use AI tools trained on App Store data to:\\n\\n- **I** dentify keyword clusters around successful terms\\n- Predict seasonal opportunities before competitors notice\\n- Find related keywords in adjacent categories\\n- Analyze competitor keyword strategies\\n\\n### Cohort analysis by acquisition source\\n\\nSegment cohort analysis by keyword clusters to understand:\\n\\n- Long-term value differences between keyword types\\n- Retention patterns by search intent\\n- Subscription renewal rates by acquisition keyword\\n- Expansion revenue potential from different user segments\\n\\n### Cross-campaign budget optimization\\n\\nUse performance data to automatically shift budgets:\\n\\n- Pause underperforming keywords based on ROAS thresholds\\n- Increase budgets for high-Share-of-Voice opportunities\\n- Reallocate spend from saturated to opportunity keywords\\n- Schedule budget increases around seasonal peaks\\n\\n![Cohort analysis table in Adapty showing weekly revenue tracking for subscription app users acquired between February-May 2024, with declining performance visible in newer cohorts compared to earlier acquisitions, illustrating the importance of cohort-based optimization for subscription businesses.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/image-5-1024x526.png)\\n\\n## What Apple Ads analysis mistakes should I avoid?\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Focusing on vanity metrics\\n\\n**Mistake:** Optimizing for low CPC or high CTR without considering subscription conversion\\n\\n**Solution:** Always tie optimizations back to revenue metrics and LTV\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Insufficient data thresholds\\n\\n**Mistake:** Making optimization decisions with 2-3 days of data\\n\\n**Solution:** Wait for statistical significance—typically 50+ taps or 1 week minimum\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Ignoring user intent differences\\n\\n**Mistake:** Treating all keyword traffic the same way\\n\\n**Solution:** Segment analysis and optimization by keyword intent and user behavior\\n\\n### 4\\\\. Over-optimization\\n\\n**Mistake:** Constantly adjusting bids based on daily performance fluctuations\\n\\n**Solution:** Use Share of Voice and weekly trends to guide bid changes\\n\\nThese mistakes are campaign killers because they create optimization based on noise rather than signal.\\n\\n## How often should I optimize my Apple Ads campaigns?\\n\\nSuccessful [Apple Search Ads optimization](https://adapty.io/apple-ads-manager) requires systematic processes, not just one-time optimizations.\\n\\n### Weekly analysis routine\\n\\n- Review Search Terms reports for new keyword opportunities and irrelevant traffic\\n- Analyze Share of Voice data to identify scaling opportunities\\n- Check cohort performance by keyword segment for LTV insights\\n- Monitor competitive patterns for budget timing opportunities\\n\\n### Monthly strategic reviews\\n\\n- Evaluate campaign structure against performance data\\n- Test new Custom Product Pages for top-performing keywords\\n- Refresh seasonal keyword strategies based on upcoming trends\\n- Review attribution setup to ensure accurate revenue tracking\\n\\n### Quarterly optimization cycles\\n\\n- Major campaign restructuring based on 3 months of performance data\\n- Geographic expansion testing for proven keyword sets\\n- Advanced segmentation implementation for personalization\\n- Budget allocation strategy updates based on market changes\\n\\n## What should I do first to improve my Apple Ads?\\n\\nEffective Apple Ads analysis and optimization for subscription apps requires moving beyond basic metrics to focus on revenue attribution, user segmentation, and systematic optimization processes.\\n\\nKey takeaways for sustainable success:\\n\\n✅ **Set up proper attribution** to track subscription revenue, not just downloads\\n\\n✅ **Use Share of Voice analysis** to identify real scaling opportunities\\n\\n✅ **Segment users by keywords** for personalized experiences that improve conversion\\n\\n✅ **Focus on ROAS and LTV metrics** rather than vanity metrics like CPC\\n\\n✅ **Build systematic processes** for ongoing analysis and optimization\\n\\n✅ **Test personalization strategies** based on keyword intent and user behavior\\n\\nThe most successful subscription apps treat Apple Ads analysis as an ongoing strategic function, not a set-and-forget campaign management task. When you build proper analysis infrastructure and optimization processes, you create a sustainable competitive advantage that compounds over time.\\n\\n**Remember**: Your goal should be acquiring subscribers who deliver long-term value, not just driving downloads. When you analyze and optimize with that focus, Apple Ads becomes a powerful engine for sustainable subscription growth.\\n\\n_This article is a comprehensive recap of our recent webinar “Scaling subscriptions with the power of ASA and ASO” featuring Simon from AppTweak and Murat from Adapty._\\n\\n**Just getting started with Apple Ads?** Read the [**Apple Ads beginner’s guide: From setup to revenue optimization**](https://adapty.io/blog/apple-search-ads/) to lay a strong foundation. **Ready to scale smartly?** Check out the [**Apple Ads guide: Best practices**](https://adapty.io/blog/apple-ads-best-practices/) for expert-level strategies and campaign design.\\n\\n_Ready to implement these strategies?_ [Start with proper attribution setup using Adapty’s one-click Apple Search Ads integration](https://app.adapty.io/registration?utm_source=adapty.io&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=apple-ads) _and begin tracking the metrics that actually matter for your subscription business._\\n\\n## Frequently asked questions about Apple Search Ads\\n\\n### How long does it take to see meaningful data from Apple Ads?\\n\\nYou need at least 50 taps or one week of data before making optimization decisions. For subscription conversion analysis, wait 2-4 weeks to account for trial periods and user onboarding flows.\\n\\n### Should I pause keywords with high CPCs but good conversion rates?\\n\\nNever pause based on CPC alone. High-CPC keywords often attract premium users with better lifetime value. Focus on ROAS and LTV:CAC ratios instead.\\n\\n### How much budget do I need to test Apple Ads effectively?\\n\\nStart with $1,000-2,000 per month minimum for meaningful testing. Split this across 2-3 geographic markets maximum to avoid spreading data too thin.\\n\\n### Can I use Apple Search Ads attribution without changing my current payment setup?\\n\\nYes, if you’re using Adapty, you can install the SDK in observer mode to get clean attribution data without migrating your existing subscription management.\\n\\n### What Share of Voice percentage should I target for my best keywords?\\n\\nAim for 70-90% Share of Voice on your highest-ROAS keywords. Beyond 90%, you’re likely overpaying without gaining meaningful additional volume.\\n\\n### How often should I check my Apple Ads performance?\\n\\nDaily monitoring for budget pacing, weekly analysis for optimization decisions, monthly strategic reviews for campaign structure changes.\\n\\n### Should I bid on competitor keywords?\\n\\nTest competitor campaigns carefully. They often have lower conversion rates but can capture users actively comparing alternatives. Monitor LTV closely.\\n\\n### What’s the difference between Discovery campaigns and broad match keywords?\\n\\nDiscovery uses Apple’s Search Match algorithm across all possible terms. Use it for keyword research with low budgets, then migrate winners to exact match campaigns.\\n\\n### How do I know if my Custom Product Pages are working?\\n\\nTrack tap-through rates and conversion improvements for specific keywords. A good CPP should improve both metrics compared to your default app store page.\\n\\n### Can small apps compete with bigger advertisers on Apple Ads?\\n\\nYes, especially in Tier 2 markets or niche keywords. Focus on long-tail terms where competition is lower and user intent is more specific.\\n\\n### Should I use automated bidding or manual bidding?\\n\\nStart with manual bidding for control and learning. Consider automated bidding only after you have clean conversion tracking and understand your target economics.\\n\\n### How do I handle seasonality in my Apple Ads campaigns?\\n\\nMonitor performance patterns quarterly, increase budgets ahead of seasonal peaks, and adjust keyword strategies based on changing user intent throughout the year.\\n\\n### What’s the minimum conversion rate that makes a keyword profitable?\\n\\nIt depends on your LTV:CAC target. Calculate backwards from your desired ROAS, if you need 3x ROAS and your ARPU is $30, you can afford $10 CPA, which determines your required conversion rate.\\n\\n### Should I target broad or specific keywords first?\\n\\nStart with specific, exact match keywords based on solid research. Broad targeting burns budget on irrelevant traffic before you understand what actually converts.\\n\\n### How do I reduce my Apple Ads costs without hurting performance?\\n\\nImprove your App Store Optimization for target keywords, test Custom Product Pages to increase relevance, and focus budget on high-LTV user segments.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

of the few product decisions that directly affects every growth metric at once, including conversion, retention, lifetime value, and revenue predictability. Yet for many app teams, it’s still treated as a late-stage decision or a copy-paste from competitors.\\n\\nThe reality is simple: the same app can succeed or fail depending on how its pricing is designed and communicated. That’s why choosing the right model should be based on what users actually need and what they’re willing to pay, not some arbitrary number.\\n\\nIn this article, we break down the most effective app pricing approaches, the monetization models that drive real profit, and a practical step-by-step framework for choosing the right pricing strategy for your app.\\n\\n## What is an app pricing model?\\n\\nAn app pricing model determines how your app generates revenue from the value it provides. It specifies when users pay, what they pay for, and how frequently.\\n\\nBut pricing affects more than transactions. It sets user expectations, affects retention, and often decides whether an app becomes a sustainable business.\\n\\nA good pricing model supports growth: users grasp the value, revenue becomes predictable, and monetization fits naturally into the experience. A bad one creates friction, reduces conversions, and caps your potential.\\n\\nPricing decisions deserve attention early. They’re central to product strategy.\\n\\n## Key app pricing approaches\\n\\nBefore choosing a specific monetization model, it’s useful to understand the broader pricing approaches that shape how prices are set and perceived.\\n\\n### Value-based pricing\\n\\nValue-based pricing starts with one question: _how much is this problem worth to the user?_ Instead of looking at costs or competitors, the price reflects the impact your app delivers – saved time, improved health, higher income, or better performance.\\n\\nThis approach works especially well for productivity, finance, health, and B2B-style apps, where value compounds over time. The challenge is that value must be communicated clearly. If users don’t immediately understand why your app matters, even a fair price will feel expensive.\\n\\n**Examples**\\n\\n- **Headspace / Calm**: users don’t pay for “audio files”; they pay for better sleep, less anxiety, and daily consistency.\\n\\n- **Notion**: the price is justified by productivity and coordination benefits, not page count.\\n\\n- **Strava**: the premium tier is sold as performance improvement and deeper training insights.\\n\\n### Competitor-based pricing\\n\\nCompetitor-based pricing uses the market as a reference point. You look at similar apps, identify the common price range, and position yourself within it.\\n\\nIt’s a safe starting point, particularly in crowded categories like fitness, meditation, or photo editing. However, it rarely leads to category leadership. When everyone prices the same, pricing stops being a differentiator. In that case, growth depends entirely on features and marketing.\\n\\n**Examples**\\n\\n- **Photo editors**: apps cluster around similar monthly pricing, with small differences in annual discounts.\\n\\n- **Fitness apps**: many converge on the same “monthly + yearly -60%” pattern because users already have an anchor.\\n\\n- **Language learning**: most products mirror each other’s tiers (monthly/annual/family) to reduce decision friction.\\n\\n### Psychological pricing\\n\\nPsychological pricing focuses on how prices _feel_, not how they’re calculated. A weekly price can feel cheaper than a monthly one. A higher-tier plan can make the middle option look more reasonable. Even a single cent can change perception.\\n\\nThis approach doesn’t create value on its own, but it can significantly improve conversion when applied thoughtfully, especially on paywalls.\\n\\n**Examples**\\n\\n- **$9.99 vs $10**: classic charm pricing still works in app stores because decisions are fast.\\n\\n- **Weekly pricing** (e.g., ~$4.99/week): makes a subscription feel “small” even if the monthly equivalent is high.\\n\\n- **Anchoring**: showing a high tier first (“Pro $19.99”) makes the mid tier (“Plus $9.99”) look like a bargain.\\n\\n- **Decoy tier**: a third option designed to push users toward the plan you actually want them to choose.\\n\\n### Tiered pricing\\n\\nTiered pricing offers multiple plans designed for different user segments. Instead of forcing everyone into the same box, you let users self-select based on needs and willingness to pay.\\n\\nWhen done right, tiers increase both conversion and lifetime value. When done poorly, they confuse users and slow down decisions.\\n\\n**Examples**\\n\\n- **Canva**: Free → Pro → Teams (each tier speaks to a different job-to-be-done).\\n\\n- **Notion**: Free/Plus/Business/Enterprise maps cleanly to personal vs team needs.\\n\\n- **Meditation apps**: “Monthly” + “Yearly” is already a tier system; some add “Family” for higher ARPU.\\n\\n### Pay-as-you-go\\n\\nPay-as-you-go pricing charges users only for what they actually use. It feels fair and transparent, which makes it attractive for AI tools, APIs, and usage-heavy apps.\\n\\nThe tradeoff is predictability. Revenue fluctuates, and forecasting becomes harder. For that reason, many apps eventually combine this model with subscriptions.\\n\\n**Examples**\\n\\n- **AI apps** selling **credits** (e.g., 100 generations, 200 prompts, 50 exports).\\n\\n- **Document scanning** apps charging per export pack.\\n\\n- **Background removal / media processing** charging per render or per minute processed.\\n\\n## 5 profit-driving app pricing models\\n\\nWith those approaches in mind, let’s look at the most common pricing models used by successful apps today.\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Freemium\\n\\nFreemium apps offer a functional free version and reserve advanced features for paying users. This model is designed for growth first and monetization second.\\n\\nIt works best when the free version demonstrates real value, but the paid version removes meaningful limitations. The biggest risk is generosity: if the free tier is too good, users never upgrade.\\n\\n**Advantages**\\n\\n- Strong top-of-funnel growth (low barrier to try)\\n- Organic sharing works better (users can invite others for free)\\n- Lets users build habit before paying\\n\\n**Disadvantages**\\n\\n- You may attract many users with low intent to pay\\n- Requires careful feature gating (too generous = no upgrades)\\n- Support and infra costs grow with free users\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **App** | **Free experience** | **Paid value** |\\n| **Spotify** | Ads, limited skips | Offline, no ads |\\n| **Notion** | Personal use | Team features, AI |\\n| **Duolingo** | Free lessons | No ads, premium perks |\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Subscription-based\\n\\nSubscriptions are the backbone of modern app monetization. Users pay regularly – weekly, monthly, or yearly – in exchange for ongoing value.\\n\\nThis model aligns revenue with retention: as long as users stay, revenue continues. The downside is churn. If users stop perceiving value, they cancel quickly, so it’s crucial to focus on onboarding and paywall optimization.\\n\\n**Advantages**\\n\\n- Predictable revenue and easier forecasting\\n- Higher LTV when retention is strong\\n- Enables continuous product investment\\n\\n**Disadvantages**\\n\\n- Churn is the enemy: value must be sustained every month\\n- Higher expectations (users demand updates and support)\\n- Paywall + onboarding must be excellent, or trials won’t convert\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **App** | **Price** | **Billing** |\\n| **Headspace** | $12.99 | Monthly |\\n| **Calm** | $69.99 | Yearly |\\n| **Strava** | $11.99 | Monthly |\\n\\n### 3\\\\. One-time purchase\\n\\nWith a one-time purchase, users pay once and unlock the full app. It’s simple, transparent, and often converts well.\\n\\nThe limitation is scale. Without recurring revenue, growth depends entirely on new users. For this reason, the model works best for niche tools with clear, static value.\\n\\n**Advantages**\\n\\n- Simple decision: pay once, no commitment anxiety\\n- Strong conversion for clear, “tool-like” value\\n- Great for niche professional apps\\n\\n**Disadvantages**\\n\\n- Revenue ceiling is capped by new users\\n- Harder to fund ongoing development\\n- Discounts become your main lever (which can hurt brand value)\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **App** | **Price** | **Category** |\\n| **Procreate** | $12.99 | Design |\\n| **Forest** | $4.99 | Productivity |\\n| **LumaFusion** | $29.99 | Video editing |\\n\\n### 4\\\\. In-app purchases\\n\\nIn-app purchases allow users to buy content, upgrades, or virtual goods inside the app. This model is especially powerful in games and social apps, where engagement loops drive repeated spending.\\n\\nIt can generate massive revenue, but it requires careful balance. Poorly designed IAPs feel manipulative and damage trust.\\n\\n**Advantages**\\n\\n- High upside (especially with strong engagement loops)\\n- Flexible monetization: you can sell to different willingness-to-pay levels\\n- Works well with social status, progression, or collection mechanics\\n\\n\\n**Disadvantages**\\n\\n- Requires careful economy design (easy to imbalance)\\n- Revenue can be volatile (seasonality + whales)\\n- Aggressive monetization can reduce trust and retention\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **App** | **Purchase type** | **Purpose** |\\n| **Clash Royale** | Currency | Progression |\\n| **Tinder** | Boosts | Visibility |\\n| **TikTok** | Coins | Creator support |\\n\\n### 5\\\\. Paymium\\n\\nPaymium combines an upfront payment with additional monetization inside the app. Users pay to enter, then pay more for extended value.\\n\\nIt filters out low-intent users and raises ARPU, but it also raises expectations. Users who pay upfront expect quality and long-term support.\\n\\n**Advantages**\\n\\n- Filters out low-intent users and improves ARPU\\n- Better unit economics early (you earn from day one)\\n- Works well for premium niches where quality matters\\n\\n**Disadvantages**\\n\\n- Harder to grow fast (paid entry reduces installs)\\n- Users expect perfection immediately\\n- If onboarding or value is unclear, refunds spike\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **App** | **Entry price** | **Extra monetization** |\\n| **Minecraft** | $6.99 | Skins |\\n| **Facetune** | Paid app | Subscription |\\n| **Enlight** | Paid app | Presets |\\n\\n## How to choose the right app pricing model\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Define your goals, audience, and KPIs\\n\\nStart with the business truth: what are you optimizing for right now?\\n\\n- Need fast growth? A low-friction model (freemium, trials) often wins.\\n- Need predictable revenue? Subscriptions are usually the default.\\n- Building a niche professional tool? One-time purchase or paymium can outperform everything else.\\n\\nLock 3–5 KPIs that will guide decisions consistently: conversion to paid, trial-to-paid, churn, ARPU, and LTV.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Measure your app costs\\n\\nBefore pricing, calculate your baseline: what it costs to acquire and serve a user.\\n\\nInclude UA, platform fees, support, infrastructure, and content production (if relevant). This step prevents the most common mistake: scaling installs while losing money.\\n\\nA simple sanity check: if CAC grows, can your pricing still recover it within an acceptable payback window?\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Define how users see your app’s value\\n\\nYour pricing model should match how value is experienced.\\n\\nIf value is immediate and “one-and-done” (like a specialized tool), a one-time purchase can make sense. If value increases with time (health, learning, productivity), subscriptions are a better fit. If value is per action (AI generations, exports), pay-as-you-go can feel fair.\\n\\nThis is also where you decide what’s “free” and what’s “paid” – and what the user must experience before you ask for money.\\n\\n### 4\\\\. Define how popular the app category is\\n\\nCategory maturity changes pricing rules.\\n\\nIn crowded categories, users have strong price anchors and low patience. You’ll need clearer differentiation, sharper positioning, and a familiar pricing format. In emerging categories, you can charge more, but you must explain more.\\n\\nThis step helps you avoid designing pricing in a vacuum.\\n\\n### 5\\\\. Check what your competitors charge\\n\\nNow look sideways – not to copy, but to learn the baseline expectations.\\n\\nAnalyze competitor paywalls: their tiers, trial lengths, annual discounts, and feature gating. The goal is to understand what users have already been trained to accept – and where you can stand out (simpler tiers, better yearly value, stronger premium story).\\n\\n### 6\\\\. Select your app pricing model\\n\\nOnly now choose the model – and keep it testable.\\n\\nFor most consumer subscription apps, a strong default is: freemium + subscription with monthly and yearly plans. For tools, one-time or paymium can work. For usage-driven products, consider credits or metered usage.\\n\\nYou don’t need to choose ‘the perfect model.’ You just need one you can iterate on without breaking the product experience.\\n\\n### 7\\\\. Validate with experiments and iterate\\n\\nTreat pricing as a growth system, not a one-time decision.\\n\\nTest paywall design, trial length, plan order, price points, and onboarding-to-paywall flow. Many apps find that the largest lift doesn’t come from changing the model but from improving how the model is presented and when users encounter it.\\n\\nThis is where tools like Adapty become a revenue multiplier: you can run faster experiments, learn from real revenue data, and roll winners out at scale.\\n\\n## Boost your app revenue with Adapty\\n\\nChoosing a pricing model is only the beginning. The real growth happens through continuous testing and optimization.\\n\\nAdapty helps subscription apps turn pricing into a measurable, scalable growth lever. With no-code paywalls, real-time analytics, and advanced A/B testing, teams can experiment without shipping new releases.\\n\\n### App onboarding builder\\n\\nPricing doesn’t start at the paywall. It starts with onboarding.\\n\\nWith [Adapty’s Onboarding Builder](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/), you can personalize user flows, highlight relevant value, and qualify intent before asking for payment, increasing conversion and reducing early churn.\\n\\nWhen pricing, onboarding, and testing work together, monetization stops being guesswork.\\n\\n### Autopilot\\n\\n[Adapty Autopilot](https://adapty.io/autopilot/) takes optimization further by automatically reallocating traffic to the best-performing paywalls based on real revenue, not just conversions. It learns which variants drive higher LTV and scales them automatically.\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### What are the 4 types of app pricing?\\n\\nThe most common types are freemium, subscription-based, one-time purchase, and in-app purchases. Many successful apps combine several of them.\\n\\n### What is an app pricing strategy?\\n\\nAn app pricing strategy defines how pricing supports business goals, user expectations, and long-term growth – not just how much the app costs.\\n\\n### What are the most popular monetization models for apps?\\n\\nSubscriptions dominate today, often combined with freemium access or in-app purchases for flexibility.\\n\\n### What is a reasonable price for an app?\\n\\nA reasonable price is one users are willing to pay repeatedly without friction. The only reliable way to find it is through testing.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Kharlan](https://adapty.io/author/vkharlan/)\\n\\nPublished August 20, 2025\\n\\nLast updated August 26, 2025\\n\\n3 min read\\n\\n![Flat-style illustration of an open book with arrows pointing to SDK, shopping bag, and analytics icons.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/adapty-docs-illustration-book.webp)\\n\\nDocumentation plays a big role in how quickly teams integrate Adapty. The clearer it is, the faster you can get from setup to growth without extra back-and-forth.\\n\\nOver the past few months, we’ve reworked our documentation with one goal in mind: making your path to integration simpler and faster. And a lot of those changes come directly from your feedback.\\n\\n## Platform-specific SDK docs\\n\\nAdapty supports [iOS](https://adapty.io/docs/ios-sdk-overview), [Android](https://adapty.io/docs/android-sdk-overview), [React Native](https://adapty.io/docs/react-native-sdk-overview), [Flutter](https://adapty.io/docs/flutter-sdk-overview), and [Unity](https://adapty.io/docs/unity-sdk-overview). Until recently, all SDK instructions were bundled together. That made it harder to find what you needed for your platform.\\n\\n![Adapty documentation with the Mobile SDK dropdown expanded, showing iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native, and Unity.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/adapty-docs-sdk-dropdown-1024x430.webp)_Choose your platform from the SDK dropdown for docs tailored to your stack_\\n\\nNow, the docs are fully **platform-specific**. From the **Mobile SDK dropdown**, select your platform and instantly see only the information that applies to you.\\n\\nEach SDK guide follows a straightforward structure:\\n\\n- Get started\\n- Identify users\\n- Work with paywalls\\n- Test your setup\\n\\n![Screenshot of Adapty iOS SDK documentation sidebar showing all available sections.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/adapty-docs-ios-get-started-1024x626.webp)_Redesigned navigation makes it easy to find exactly what you need._\\n\\n## Quickstart guides\\n\\nWe also introduced **Quickstart guides** designed to get you from your very first step in Adapty to your first in-app purchase as quickly as possible.\\n\\nOn the main Docs page, the [Quickstart guide section](https://adapty.io/docs/quickstart) walks through onboarding in five simple steps.\\n\\n![Adapty documentation showing a five-step Quickstart guide in the sidebar.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/adapty-docs-quickstart-guide-1024x517.webp)_Quickstart guides walk you through integration in five simple steps.ly what you need._\\n\\nEach SDK has its own [Get started](https://adapty.io/docs/ios-sdk-overview) section, everything a developer needs to install and configure Adapty, ready to share with your team.\\n\\n![Adapty iOS SDK documentation sidebar highlighting the “Get started” steps.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/adapty-docs-ios-full-nav-1024x445.webp)_Each SDK guide follows a clear structure: install, configure, test, and release._\\n\\n## LLM-optimized docs\\n\\nOne of our users said it best: _“The best documentation is documentation you can feed directly into an LLM.”_\\n\\nWe’ve made that possible. Every docs page now includes a **View as Markdown** option. Click it to see a plain-text version, or use **Copy for LLM** to grab the entire article instantly.\\n\\n![Adapty Docs Copy For Llm 1](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/adapty-docs-copy-for-llm-1-1024x516.webp)_Easily copy any docs page in Markdown or plain text, ready to use with LLMs._\\n\\nWe also provide an **llms.txt file** to help AI tools fetch clean, text-only versions of our docs. For some AI agents (like ChatGPT), you can download the file and upload it directly, making integrations even easier.\\n\\nTo learn more, see our detailed guide on [using LLMs to implement Adapty](https://adapty.io/docs/adapty-cursor).\\n\\n## **Your feedback shapes what’s next**\\n\\nThese improvements exist because of the feedback you’ve shared. And we’re not stopping here. Every comment helps us refine the experience further, so don’t hesitate to use the feedback form on any docs page.\\n\\n![Adapty documentation page with a purple feedback widget asking “Was this page helpful?”](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/08/adapty-docs-feedback-form-1024x557.webp)_Share feedback directly on any page — your input shapes the next improvements._\\n\\nClearer docs. Faster integrations. Less time wasted. That’s our goal and we’re building it together with you.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

After reaching over 6 billion downloads in 2025, marketers and brands are recognizing the chokehold that TikTok has over every other social media platform when it comes to advertisements.\\n\\nAnd so, TikTok ads are where you should be zooming in!\\n\\nOver the course of years, TikTok has developed an extensive range of advertisement types for brands to choose from. These ads target demographics differently as some of them are unskippable full-screen traditional commercials while others foster a sense of community to build their images.\\n\\nIf I’ve got you hooked so far, let’s talk about why you should even be considering the app for your advertisement needs in the first place.\\n\\n## Why advertise on TikTok?\\n\\nBefore 2016, nobody knew what a TikTok was. But today, TikTok is the #1 platform marketers and brands use as a way to promote their products or services.\\n\\nFrom names like Jennifer Lopez and Charli D’Amelio to companies like Tesla and Sephora, every successful brand is heavily advertising itself and going viral on TikTok.\\n\\nThe reason is simple: TikTok is the best platform to promote your brand for more reasons than one.\\n\\nIn Q1 of 2022, Tiktok became the most downloaded app globally and [even surpassed Google as the most popular web domain](https://blog.cloudflare.com/popular-domains-year-in-review-2021/)! By Q3 of the same year, it [became the world’s highest-grossing app](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/29/tiktok-breaks-records-as-top-grossing-app-in-q3-as-overall-app-store-revenue-declines/) and currently has 1.2 billion active users. But how did it do that?\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, TikTok caters to a wide range of demographics. It’s not the app for teenagers anymore; it’s where your target demographic is! And they’re actively spending an hour every day on the app, making it the perfect app to launch your campaigns into.\\n\\n![fEaVjn0czsEsnXeMbwV0lN1Lis9iInDsuUKJ7MhnjrIruWziq1pKalKAJ10QjQk8nkqeEI9lYwxpmi RgP6gcD07SA5DVADSxLk2Y9i52pnwp ZAj9zXcrx4C4M9NJpn0 hAbNdU9Q twbNjWGuTIyA](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fEaVjn0czsEsnXeMbwV0lN1Lis9iInDsuUKJ7MhnjrIruWziq1pKalKAJ10QjQk8nkqeEI9lYwxpmi-RgP6gcD07SA5DVADSxLk2Y9i52pnwp-ZAj9zXcrx4C4M9NJpn0-hAbNdU9Q_twbNjWGuTIyA)\\n\\nI’m not done with the statistics just yet. TikTok also has the highest engagement rates when compared to other social media sites. While Instagram’s average engagement is approximately 3%, [TikTok stands as a winner with an engagement rate of 8.2%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1372608/tiktok-video-engagement-by-duration/)!\\n\\nWhen it comes to actual advertisement, you can implement more effective video marketing on the platform to a plethora of audiences (20% of the global population).\\n\\nYou can showcase your products authentically on TikTok to an audience that’s already engaged and active! This can mean increased brand exposure while staying ahead of the social media marketing curve.\\n\\nLast but not least, TikTok offers a variety of ad formats, such as In-Feed Ads, Branded Hashtag Challenges, and Branded Effects. These formats provide creative freedom and allow brands to craft engaging and memorable advertising experiences!\\n\\nReady to know more about these different ad formats that make TikTok the perfect app to start?\\n\\n## The 8 TikTok Ad Formats Explained\\n\\nWhen it comes to advertising and spreading brand awareness, TikTok’s ad group range really serves marketers well. Not only are you free to choose a creative strategy that fits your campaign objectives, but each type within these ad groups targets users differently!\\n\\nThat said, let’s jump into the 8 types of TikTok ad formats!\\n\\n## 1\\\\. TikTok in-feed ads\\n\\nIn feed ads on TikTok are a form of native advertising that seamlessly integrates promotional content into a user’s feed, making them appear as regular TikTok videos.\\n\\nThese ads typically show up in a user’s “For You” feed, sandwiched between organic user-generated content, and are designed to be engaging and visually appealing.\\n\\nIn-feed ads can vary in format, including short videos, image slideshows, or GIFs, and usually feature a recognizable “Sponsored” label to denote their commercial nature. Not sure if this TikTok ad format is meant for you? Here are some pros and cons of using in-feed ads:\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\\n| Feels like native content | High competition with other videos for TikTok user attention |\\n| Has clickable features |  |\\n| CTA buttons can take users to internal and external landing pages |  |\\n\\nThe latest example of successful in-feed ads on TikTok is [Maybelline’s Superstay Vinyl Ink.](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/inspiration/maybelline-superstay%20vinyl%20ink%20?) The in-feed ads led to a +95% glance views on Amazon and a whopping 55 million impressions within 24 hours!\\n\\n### Specs for in-feed ads\\n\\n- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (recommended)\\n- **Resolution:** must be ≥540\\\\*960px, ≥640\\\\*640px, or ≥960\\\\*540px.\\n- **Length:** up to 60s (recommended 9-15s)\\n- **File Options:**.mp4, .mov, .mpeg, .3gp, or .avi\\n- **File Sizes:** less than 500 MB\\n\\n## 2\\\\. TikTok brand takeover ads\\n\\nYou might’ve come across a brand takeover ad campaign when you open the TikTok app and come across an unskippable full-screen ad on your FYP.\\n\\nThis TikTok ad type takes over your screen for a few seconds and turns into one of the in-feed video ads. They can come across as GIFs, static images, and videos. But, TikTok only shows 1 brand takeover ad per day to its users.\\n\\nBut these full-screen ads provide an immersive experience, driving sales and impressions within a short time. Plus, you can always create and add your own custom logo to create lasting brand awareness!\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\\n| Guarantees a high number of impressions | Can be identified as an ad |\\n| Can not be skipped | Unable to like or comment |\\n\\n### Specs for brand takeover ads\\n\\n- **Aspect Ratios:** 9:16, 1:1, or 16:9\\n- **Length:** 5 seconds\\n- **File Options for Video:** .mp4, .mov, .mpeg, .3gp, or .avi\\n- **File Types for Static Images:** JPG or PNG.\\n- **File Size:** 500 MB\\n\\n## 3\\\\. TikTok TopView ads\\n\\nWant to take your advertising game with an ad format that is [67% more effective](https://megadigital.ai/en/blog/tiktok-ad-types/) than any other type of TikTok ad?\\n\\nThe biggest example of a successful ad strategy using topView ads is [eOne’s campaign for the movie Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/inspiration/eONe-dungeons-and-dragons-tiktok-success-story). It resulted in over 50 million impressions and a cost per view of $0.02!\\n\\nThese video-first format ads have a duration of 60 seconds and make an immediate appearance upon launching the TikTok app.\\n\\nWhat sets these ads apart is their distinctive nature: they occupy the entire screen and play automatically with sound.\\n\\nPlus, advertisers have the option to include a call-to-action button within the ad itself! Talk about being a “must-see” ad…\\n\\nIf your aim is to deliver ads that seamlessly blend into the TikTok experience, TopView ads might not be your top choice. Because they interrupt the user experience with their length and full-screen feel, they’re quite similar to traditional commercials!\\n\\nHowever, despite their more traditional feel, TopView ads can be remarkably effective. An impressive [71% of TikTokers acknowledge that TopView ads successfully capture their attention](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/apps/tiktok)!\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\\n| Immersive experience cuts out competition | Can easily be identified as an ad |\\n| Receives a higher number of impressions |  |\\n| Works nicely for brand awareness |  |\\n\\n### Specs for TopView ads\\n\\n- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16, 1:1, or 16:9\\n- **Resolution:** must be ≥ 540\\\\*960px, ≥ 640\\\\*640px, or ≥ 960\\\\*540px.\\n- **Length:** up to 60 seconds\\n- **File Types:**.mp4, .mov, .mpeg, .3gp, or .avi\\n- **File Size:** ≤ 500 MB\\n\\n## 4\\\\. TikTok branded effects\\n\\nAre you a fan of trendy filters, stickers, and effects? Well, you might already be familiar with what branded effects ads are!\\n\\nCheetos launched itself in Egypt recently and chose TikTok as the platform to advertise. Users were encouraged to show off their zigzag dance to original music and a Cheetos background. [Garnering over 92 million video views and a 13.3% brand awareness increase](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/inspiration/cheetos-tiktok), the company ran a colorful branded effect for 4 weeks to target the Gen Z community!\\n\\n![qYZFGQAZwojMPQZxSBexYSowCsdo2RheNgHBPT9EYw0RekzqyVeBFClSn q0HjOFS6dRm3CM5 yob4mlwkHTNYQZsgCUOxSaTPp6jFfym0KmqsgcSXGn1L51PyKbVBHcVt enwjCq8fy U5J2hEd9NQ](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qYZFGQAZwojMPQZxSBexYSowCsdo2RheNgHBPT9EYw0RekzqyVeBFClSn_q0HjOFS6dRm3CM5_yob4mlwkHTNYQZsgCUOxSaTPp6jFfym0KmqsgcSXGn1L51PyKbVBHcVt-enwjCq8fy_U5J2hEd9NQ)\\n\\nSimilar to Instagram and Snapchat, TikTok’s branded Effects empower brands to craft shareable stickers, filters, and special effects as a way to self-promote!\\n\\nWhile it’s certainly not strong enough to be your sole advertising aspect on the app, it does boost your visibility on the app and gives you the chance to go viral.

TikTok branded hashtag challenge\\n\\nHeavily relying upon user-generated content (UGC), the branded hashtag challenge is a sneaky way to promote your brand on TikTok. This one’s less of an ad and more of a campaigning strategy to improve brand awareness by encouraging user participation!\\n\\nWith the branded hashtag challenge, your brand will encourage users to dance, lip-sync, or create their own renditions. When they post their videos on the TikTok app, they’ll add the branded hashtag in the caption!\\n\\nBranded hashtag challenge is often featured at the top of TikTok’s FYP and leads to [8.5% greater engagement than other types of ads](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/apps/tiktok#4)!\\n\\nHere are some of the most successful branded hashtag challenges:\\n\\n- Guess’ #InMyDenim – resulted in +5,500 user-generated videos and 10 million views.\\n- Colgate’s #MakeMomSmile – reached +4.6 billion views\\n- Nissan’s #improvisewithJUKE – garnered +129 million video views\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\\n| Popularity can mean high user engagement | Relies heavily on user-generated content |\\n| Comes across as organic content |  |\\n| Can go viral and improve brand awareness |  |\\n\\n### Specs for branded hashtags\\n\\n- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16\\n- **Resolution:** must be ≥540\\\\*960px, ≥640\\\\*640px, or ≥960\\\\*540px.\\n- **Length:** up to 60s (recommended 9-15s)\\n- **File Options:**.mp4, .mov, .mpeg, .3gp, or .avi\\n- **File Sizes:** less than 500 MB\\n\\n## 6\\\\. Collection Ads\\n\\nWhile not yet accessible to all users, TikTok Collection Ads offer a unique advertising format worthy of exploration. These ads are designed to enable users to seamlessly explore and browse products via their mobile devices in full-screen mode.\\n\\nThe distinct feature of Collection Ads lies in the creation of an ad that directs users to an Instant Gallery Page, a curated and inspiring collection of your products, all accessible without leaving the TikTok app.\\n\\nCollection ads are designed to deliver a faster, more captivating advertising experience that encourages immediate action from TikTok users!\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\\n| Offers an engaging and immersive ad experience for users | Can be more expensive than other ad formats |\\n| Improves engagement with the swiping option | High competition for user attention |\\n| Promotes brand value |  |\\n\\n### Specs for collection ads\\n\\n- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16, 1:1, or 16:9\\n- **Resolution:** must be 720 x 1280px, 640 x 640px, or 1280 x 720px.\\n- **Length**: 5-16s (recommended 10s)\\n- **File Options:**.mp4, .mov, .mpeg, or .avi\\n- **File Sizes:** less than 500 MB\\n\\n## 7\\\\. Dynamic Showcase Ads (DSAs)\\n\\nDynamic Showcase Ads enable brands to feature a range of products, often displayed in a carousel or grid format, within a single ad! This is a great ad type to indulge in if your brand is in the e-commerce space.\\n\\nOne of the key features of Dynamic Showcase Ads is the ability to automatically update the showcased products in real-time. This means that advertisers can easily keep their product listings current, reflecting the latest inventory or promotions.\\n\\nYou have creative flexibility in designing the appearance and layout of your Dynamic Showcase Ads. From incorporating eye-catching visuals, and compelling product descriptions, to branding elements to make the ad more appealing to viewers, the sky is the limit!\\n\\nBy showcasing multiple products and providing a seamless shopping experience, Dynamic Showcase Ads can increase user engagement and drive conversions, ultimately leading to increased sales for brands.\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\\n| Gives you the option to create highly personalized experiences | Limited A/B testing options |\\n| Automatically updates with latest products | Complex setup for beginners |\\n| Boosts conversions and engagement | Resource-intensive |\\n\\n### Specs for dynamic showcase ads\\n\\n- **Resolution:** 720 x 1280px, 640 x 640px, or 1280 x 720px\\n- **Length:** 5-16s (recommended 10s)\\n- **File Options:**.mp4, .mov, .mpeg, or .avi\\n- **File Sizes:** less than 500 MB\\n\\n## 8\\\\. Shopping Ads\\n\\n[Shopping ads](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-world-shopping-ads?redirected=1) were recently introduced by TikTok in October 2022 as an improved way for e-commerce brands on the platform to reach their target audience with ease.\\n\\nAccording to TikTok itself, shopping ads are a “simpler, smarter, and more advanced ad solution that helps brands meet shoppers wherever they are in the purchase journey, sparking demand and boosting sales.”\\n\\nThe best news? There are 3 different types of ads within Tiktok’s Shopping Ads!\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\\n| Can directly drive e-commerce revenue | Highly competitive landscape |\\n| Access to detailed data on user interactions and conversions | Users may become desensitized to shopping ads over time |\\n| Allows highly creative TikTok ad campaign strategies |  |\\n\\n### Video Shopping Ads\\n\\nVideo shopping ads are strategically placed as hyper-relevant, clickable videos throughout the For You page, enabling new customers to effortlessly explore and purchase products.\\n\\nPowered by advanced targeting capabilities, Video Shopping Ads ensure that your products are showcased to users with a higher likelihood of making a purchase.\\n\\nWith the video feature, TikTok users are quickly attracted to this type of TikTok advertising, which can lead to sales much more efficiently!\\n\\n### Catalog Listing Ads\\n\\nWith Catalog Listing Ads, marketers who don’t want to get into a creative hitch can quickly get started—no additional assets needed!\\n\\nThese ads allow you to display your products alongside those of other merchants, creating new shopping destinations where users with aligned interests and stronger purchase intent can seamlessly discover and make purchases.\\n\\n### Live Shopping Ads\\n\\nLive Shopping Ads are purpose-built to drive engagement directly from the For You page to Live Shopping events. They invite users to join the experience and uncover exciting new products through livestreams!\\n\\nBeyond increasing traffic to LIVE events, these ads, much like other Shopping ad formats, are strategically designed to present your products to potential buyers who are more inclined to make a purchase.\\n\\n### TikTok ad formats comparison table\\n\\n| Ad format | Best for | Placement | Max duration | Key specs |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **In-Feed Ads** | Engagement, installs | Feed | 5–60s | 9:16 / 1:1 |\\n| **TopView** | Brand awareness | Launch placement | Up to 60s | 9:16 |\\n| **Brand takeover** | Maximum visibility | App open | 3–5s | 9:16 |\\n| **Spark ads** | Native UGC | Feed | As original | Creator content |\\n\\n## TikTok Ads Manager\\n\\nTikTok Ads Manager is the official and powerful platform for businesses and advertisers to create, manage, and optimize their advertising campaigns on TikTok.\\n\\nThis robust tool empowers advertisers to tap into TikTok’s extensive user base, create compelling ad content, and drive meaningful engagement with their target audience.\\n\\nWith TikTok Ads Manager, advertisers have the flexibility to create a variety of ad formats, including video ads, image ads, carousel ads, and more. They can upload their creative assets, craft persuasive ad copy, and tailor the ad format to align with their specific campaign objectives.\\n\\nOne of the standout features of TikTok Ads Manager is its advanced audience targeting capabilities. Advertisers can precisely define their target audience based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and more.\\n\\nThis precise targeting ensures that ads are shown to users who are most likely to resonate with the content and take action.\\n\\nBudget management is made seamless through TikTok Ads Manager, allowing advertisers to set daily or lifetime spending limits. Real-time insights into ad spend and performance help advertisers monitor their budgets effectively and adjust as needed.\\n\\nThe platform also provides in-depth performance tracking and analytics, offering valuable insights into key metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and return on investment (ROI).\\n\\nYou can leverage these insights to optimize their campaigns, maximize their reach, and achieve their advertising goals!\\n\\n## TikTok ads pricing\\n\\nPrecisely determining the cost of TikTok Ads can be elusive, as TikTok offers multiple ad types, each with its own pricing range. To grasp the exact costs associated with each ad solution, it’s crucial to understand TikTok’s various ad-buying methods.\\n\\nCurrently, advertisers can acquire TikTok ads using three distinct approaches:\\n\\n- Bidding (also known as cost per click or CPC)\\n- Booking\\n- Reach and frequency\\n\\nEach of these buying methods aligns with different campaign objectives, depending on your goals when advertising on TikTok.\\n\\nAmong these options, bidding is the most common, adaptable, and accessible method suitable for businesses of all sizes, whether aiming for sales or branding campaigns.\\n\\n### Bidding Types\\n\\nTikTok offers five bidding ad types, such as In-Feed, Collection, Dynamic Showcase, TikTok Shopping Solutions, and Deeplink to Marketplace.\\n\\nKey features of bidding methods include ease of creation through TikTok Ads Manager, flexible costs with no upfront fees, no need to purchase ad space separately, and suitability for optimizing conversion efficiency.\\n\\n### Booking Types\\n\\nThis approach is available due to limited ad placements. Advertisers interested in specific ad formats like TopView, Branded Effect, and Branded Hashtag Challenge must book in advance to secure their ad slots.\\n\\nBooking methods generally involve higher costs compared to bidding types and require advance booking and payment through TikTok agencies like Mega Digital. These exclusive ad solutions are unique to TikTok and are effective for increasing brand awareness.\\n\\n### Reach and Frequency\\n\\nReach and Frequency (R&F) provides advertisers with control over target audience reach and ad frequency based on a predetermined budget. R&F comes in two distribution forms:\\n\\n- Standard, and\\n- Top Feed.\\n\\nThe latter is an advanced setting that optimizes the display position for the standard distribution. This form of advertising is often used in conjunction with other ad types to maximize audience reach, interactions, and brand recognition.\\n\\n### What influences TikTok ad prices?\\n\\nBecause there is no set value on how much your TikTok ads can cost you, it can be confusing to figure out your marketing budget.\\n\\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should keep $500 initially as your advertising costs on TikTok. But there are many brands on the platform that spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising too!\\n\\nHere are 4 factors that impact TikTok ad prices:\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Ad formats** | Different ad formats, such as video ads or carousel ads, can have varying costs based on user engagement and platform demand. |\\n| **Target audience** | Ads targeting a broad audience may have lower costs, but highly specific or niche targeting can increase costs due to limited reach. |\\n| **Bidding strategy** | The choice between automatic and manual bidding can impact costs, as manual bidding allows advertisers to control their bid amounts. |\\n| **Competition** | High demand for ad placements within a specific audience segment or at certain times can increase ad costs. More competition often means higher prices. |\\n\\n## How to run ads on TikTok\\n\\nRunning TikTok ads can be a powerful way to connect with a vast and engaged audience. Here’s a step-by-step guide to launching an ad campaign on TikTok:\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Setting up an advertising campaign\\n\\nBefore you start creating your TikTok ads, it’s essential to establish a clear plan for your advertising campaign.\\n\\nStart by defining your campaign objectives. Ask yourself what you want to achieve with your ads on TikTok. The most common objectives include:\\n\\n- increasing brand awareness,\\n- driving website traffic,\\n- promoting app installs, or\\n- generating leads.\\n\\nOnce you’ve set your objectives, it’s time to consider your target audience. TikTok provides robust targeting options based on factors like demographics, interests, behavior, and location. Carefully define your target audience to ensure your ads reach the right people.\\n\\nWith your objectives and target audience in mind, you can now establish specific campaign goals. These goals should be measurable and aligned with your overall objectives.\\n\\nFor example, if your objective is to boost website visits, your goal might be to achieve a certain number of clicks within a defined timeframe.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Setting up budget and bidding\\n\\nDetermining your ad campaign’s budget is a critical step in the process. TikTok offers two budget options: daily and lifetime. Daily budgets allocate a set amount of money each day, while lifetime budgets allow you to specify a total budget for the entire campaign duration.\\n\\nNext, you’ll need to choose a bidding strategy. TikTok provides two main options:\\n\\n#### Automatic Bidding\\n\\nWith automatic bidding, TikTok will set bids on your behalf to help you achieve your campaign objectives. This option offers simplicity and convenience, as TikTok’s algorithms handle bid adjustments.\\n\\n#### Manual Bidding\\n\\nIf you prefer more control over your bids, you can opt for manual bidding. In this case, you specify the maximum bid amount you’re willing to pay for the desired action, such as a click or conversion. Manual bidding allows for fine-tuning and experimentation to optimize your results.\\n\\nRegardless of your chosen bidding strategy, it’s essential to continuously monitor your campaign’s performance. You can adjust your budget and bids based on the data you collect to optimize your campaign over time.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Creating your TikTok ads\\n\\nNow, let’s focus on the creative aspect of your TikTok ad campaign:\\n\\n#### Ad Creatives\\n\\nTikTok is the king of fast information. And because the platform is known for its short-form videos, consider creating engaging and visually captivating video content.\\n\\nKeep your videos concise and attention-grabbing, as TikTok users have short attention spans. Incorporate elements that align with TikTok trends and culture to resonate with the audience.\\n\\n#### Uploading Media\\n\\nUse TikTok’s ad creation platform to upload your media assets. Ensure that your videos or images meet TikTok’s specifications in terms of resolution, aspect ratio, and file format. TikTok provides guidance on these requirements during the ad creation process.\\n\\n#### Captions and CTAs\\n\\nCraft compelling captions that complement your visuals. Your captions should be concise and relevant to your ad’s message. You also should include a clear call to action (CTA) that instructs viewers on what action to take after watching your TikTok ads!\\n\\nWhether it’s visiting your website, downloading an app, or making a purchase, the CTA should be persuasive and straightforward.\\n\\nOnce your TikTok ad campaign is set up and your creative assets are ready, TikTok will review your campaign to ensure it aligns with its guidelines and policies. Once approved, your ads will begin running, and you can closely monitor their performance through TikTok’s ad manager.\\n\\n## Best practices for TikTok ads\\n\\nNow that you’ve conquered practically every piece of information on TikTok ad formats, it’s time to learn how you can make the best of your TikTok ad campaign strategies!\\n\\nSo, dear reader, let me hook you to 3 tried-and-tested best practices for TikTok ads:\\n\\n### Always add captions and descriptions\\n\\nAd descriptions and captions kill two birds with one stone. It’s an excellent way to support visual and auditory messages to people who have disabilities, as well as those who don’t have their volumes up — guilty as charged!\\n\\nBut captions and descriptions go beyond that. They also build your story by adding factual bits and expanding on the narrative you’re revealing about your brand! It’s the way to go if you’re looking to connect on a personal level with your target audience.\\n\\n### Balance promotion with entertainment\\n\\nBalancing entertainment-related content and advertising on TikTok is key to effectively reaching your audience. With [entertainment garnering a massive 535 billion hashtag views on the platform](https://thesocialshepherd.com/blog/tiktok-statistics#:~:text=And%20according%20to%20TikTok%20statistics,%2C%20and%20home%20renovations%2FDIY.), it’s essential to strike the right equilibrium.\\n\\nThe strategy is to utilize engaging elements to captivate your audience’s attention, and then seamlessly integrate promotional content that gently introduces them to your product or brand.\\n\\nFor newcomers to TikTok, a gradual approach works well. Begin by kick-starting your account with [entertainment-focused ads](https://tinuiti.com/blog/paid-social/tiktok-examples-of-ads/) that resonate with the platform’s lively and creative community.\\n\\nAs users become more familiar with your presence and content, gradually introduce promotional material that offers value. Consider how-to guides and interactive videos that showcase your product’s benefits and unique features.\\n\\n### Partner with creators\\n\\nIf you’re trying to grow your brand and reach a wider range of audiences, micro-influencers, and content creators are crucial elements of your strategy.\\n\\nThese people already have a well-set rapport in the digital space with a loyal and often large following, which can help you get traction in a new-to-you niche!\\n\\nThis is especially a piece of advice to keep close to heart if you’re dipping your toes into unknown territory.\\n\\nTo partner up with a content creator on TikTok, you should:\\n\\n- Research influencers in your desired space,\\n- Analyze their engagement rates against their follower count,\\n- Reach out for a paid partnership to promote your product!\\n\\nThe Wildest is a pet care app that empowers pet parents with easy-to-use resources. They partnered with influencers on the app (see below) and ended up [having over 10,000 sign-ups and over 1 million registrations](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/inspiration/the-wildest-pet-parenting)!\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nTikTok is the app to be. Whether you’re looking to entertain yourself on your daily commute, gain knowledge, or advertise your products to TikTok users, the app gives you a lot of creative freedom.\\n\\nSome might even call it a discovery funnel, where you never run out of new things!\\n\\nBecause it’s where almost 20% of the human population is connecting with each other, TikTok is the ideal platform to launch your advertisement campaigns. TikTok recognizes its importance in social media marketing because it gives you 8 different types of ad formats to choose from!\\n\\n## FAQs about Tiktok ad formats\\n\\n### What are the main TikTok ad formats?\\n\\nThe main TikTok ad formats include In-Feed Ads, TopView Ads, Brand Takeover Ads, Spark Ads, and Collection Ads.

While other aspect ratios are supported, vertical videos usually deliver the best performance.\\n\\n### How long should TikTok ads be?\\n\\nAlthough TikTok allows ads up to 60 seconds long, the recommended duration is usually between 9 and 15 seconds. Shorter ads tend to perform better because they capture attention quickly and align with typical user behavior on the platform.\\n\\n### What’s the difference between Spark Ads and regular In-Feed Ads?\\n\\nRegular In-Feed Ads are created and published directly from an advertiser’s account. Spark Ads, on the other hand, promote existing organic content from a brand or creator account.

Many users watch TikTok videos without sound, so captions help improve message clarity, accessibility, and overall engagement.\\n\\n### Can you run A/B tests on TikTok ads?\\n\\nYes, TikTok supports A/B testing through its split testing features.

Part4](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/62d51d1f43bd691be3c8dc1e_paywall-ab-testing-guide-part4-scaled.png)\\n\\nThe main goal of this series is to introduce you to the paywall A/B testing, give you some ideas that you could start with, and, hopefully, inspire you to achieve great results. We learned that running paywall experiments can be beneficial and profitable, but you need to know how to actually set them up. Let’s talk about the general aspects of launching an A/B test and the tools that will help you do this.\\n\\nThis is the third part of our paywall A/B testing guide, so if you haven’t, make sure to check out the previous articles to get some insights from the marketing approach to experimenting:\\n\\n1. [Paywall A/B testing guide, part 1: how to approach split-testing and avoid mistakes](https://adapty.io/blog/paywall-ab-testing-mistakes/)\\n2.

Paywall A/B testing guide, part 3: how to run A/B tests on paywalls and why it can be difficult\\n4. [Paywall A/B testing guide, part 4: how to run experiments in Adapty](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-run-a-b-test-for-mobile-paywalls-in-adapty)\\n\\n## Choosing the A/B testing framework\\n\\nTo run A/B tests, you have to use a special framework that would be integrated in your app and have a console that would gather analytical data and “communicate” with your app via **remote config** (we’ll talk about it a bit further). There are two ways to implement this step: develop your own framework or integrate an already existing one.\\n\\n![62c58ae90d72c3836f604614 kccnyi072twwcuhl8gxg9puuyo12rdbs1g1jhyrwwxv gqyi5cp3i3mg6vhsp9 r6uklkjjbu81zrzr216mypvtz6msif j3mwrc3pb sfem2wr9g5g5aptjhsrtwkmudyjghiiaho6ogvmoca](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/62c58ae90d72c3836f604614_kccnyi072twwcuhl8gxg9puuyo12rdbs1g1jhyrwwxv_gqyi5cp3i3mg6vhsp9-r6uklkjjbu81zrzr216mypvtz6msif-j3mwrc3pb-sfem2wr9g5g5aptjhsrtwkmudyjghiiaho6ogvmoca.png)_Basic analytics in the Google Firebase console_\\n\\nCreating your own testing framework is a major undertaking that would require development in the back end, coming up with something resembling an admin console, setting up databases, implementing logic, and much more. Plus, it would require time to test the framework itself, fix all the bugs, and finally come up with a functioning prototype. Such a development would require several months and a couple of developers working non-stop. It’s challenging but may be rewarding in the long run. However, it may be more rewarding to integrate an already well-functioning side framework, which would take a couple of days, and start testing your ideas.\\n\\nThere are frameworks that allow developers to run A/B tests in their apps, providing certain analytics and even offering integrations with 3rd-party services. Some frameworks can be integrated and used for free (e.g. Firebase) and some have a free trial but offer pro plans for regular use (e.g. Adapty), but they usually offer more useful features and deeper analytics. It’s up to you which framework to choose, for starters, [Firebase](https://adapty.io/integrations/google-analytics-firebase/) may be enough. But no matter which one you choose, the main aspects of their functionality remain the same.\\n\\n## Main aspects of an A/B testing framework\\n\\nLet’s have a look at the general steps of how A/B testing frameworks function. First, you need to integrate the frameworks’ SDK, so that you’d be able to view all the analytical data from your app through the control panel. In that very panel, you’ll be able to set up and follow experiments.\\n\\nThe framework enables you to configure paywall elements with the help of  **Remote Config**– a piece of code that allows you to substitute one variable with another, almost in real-time. But it’s important to understand that your app must be ready for all the changes that you intend to make with the paywall. You must first include in the app’s code the “placeholders” for all the things you’d want to test: the number of products, possible pricing options, and any visual or textual element. Only then can they be controlled and changed from the console. Apart from the remote config code, you’d also have to insert certain **fetch**, **activate**, and **get** methods.\\n\\n![](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/62c58ae9a9f503134ba010a4_qzpvp93_36msaem4_occhzme__fx75qzls7xtwbnhvcmmiv_jnuaol1c9arlgejudfusfjqxfvzwzgzf5uzyqu6a6fxftrftayylc4uq8cgpep7xvrmkdfzna8utdftng4rtsqlqyocvl7i3kg.png)_Example of the Remote Config code for the paywall_\\n\\nAfter the app is ready, you can proceed to create the experiment in the framework’s console. Usually, the steps are as follows:\\n\\n- Name the experiment\\n- Set up the targeting: select your app, set the percentage of the target audience that will see the testing version of the paywall (50/50, 75/25, etc.), add some additional events to narrow down the audience\\n- Set the goal of the experiment. It could be the purchase income or any other metrics and conversion rates\\n- Create the A and B testing versions of the paywall. Choose the parameter that you’re going to test, which should be of a different version for each paywall.\\n- Set up additional targeting methods: activation events, app version, localization, country, language, or any other user property\\n- Launch the test\\n\\n![62c58b332cb363c84727d904 333](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/62c58b332cb363c84727d904_333.png)_Creating a Remote Config experiment in Firebase_\\n\\nA/B tests are usually based on testing one parameter, but the frameworks usually allow running tests with more than one. It’s not practical to run tests with 2 or more parameters, as in the end, you wouldn’t have a clear picture of what exactly affected the result of the experiment: was it one of the elements or all of them together? But this ability is provided because there may be design cases with 2 (or more) co-dependent elements, and changing one element requires changing the other one. For example, if you change the background color to a brighter tone, you may want to change the text properties as well, so that it looks darker and more readable.\\n\\nIn some frameworks, the Remote Config feature is presented in the form of JSON, a simple format for data interchanging. Basically, you can decide in advance which elements of the paywall you’d want to test in the future and sign them with corresponding nicknames that will be used in the JSON file. We recommend creating a spreadsheet with all the variables and values they may possess (e.g ca\\\\_button – red, blue, yellow, for the call-to-action button and the colors it may have), and then turning this in the JSON format, on your own, or with the help of the developer. It will be easier to find and edit these variables in the Remote Config field afterward without asking for someone’s help.\\n\\n![62c58ae97dc7651222463543 el98vfahrbfwqhvmwgeibcssamzocvsqwfil bjcwtbxqefednikn6whvlwxnexqfxgm2hn3epxtme1wmctlo8xgwij](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/62c58ae97dc7651222463543_el98vfahrbfwqhvmwgeibcssamzocvsqwfil-bjcwtbxqefednikn6whvlwxnexqfxgm2hn3epxtme1wmctlo8xgwij-unto_ean7tlp7ljgj5jblb32pzvykhxvtcestbcochswkfjobpthxw.png)_Prepare a spreadsheet with all the variables that can be tested in Remote Config as a JSON_\\n\\nEven though Firebase may be good for testing simple UI changes, or adding/deleting features, its analytical power may not be enough to properly assess much more complex experiments with a delayed economic effect. Moreover, Firebase allows you to track a lot of events, but the events’ parameters are limited only to 5, which is frustrating and inconvenient. It means that you can get high-level data, but won’t be able to go deeper into details, where usually the most insightful information lies.\\n\\nIn this case, you’d either have to use BigQuery, which requires SQL knowledge, or any other 3rd-party analytics systems, which are mostly paid.\\n\\nThere’s also a difference in the way Firebase and other paid frameworks work with events. Firebase processes all the attribution events on the client’s side only, as it doesn’t communicate with other servers. In more advanced frameworks, only the primary attribution event is processed on the client (e.g. initial purchase), and all the further events (renewals, cancellations, billing issues, etc) take place on the server (Apple or Google). This helps gather more relevant and true-to-life analytical data.\\n\\nIf you don’t want to bother with complexities, it would be a good choice to try some paid service that would have all the data in one place and in a convenient format. Apart from A/B testing, such services also provide additional analytical features that can be very helpful in the process of growing your app: cohort analysis, user profiles, segmentation by different parameters, native integrations with 3rd-party services, etc. If you are interested in trying Adapty as a framework for your test, in the [next article](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-run-a-b-test-for-mobile-paywalls-in-adapty) we’ll explain how to integrate [Adapty SDK](https://adapty.io/sdk/) and start running paywall tests in your app.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

This is the fourth tutorial in our comprehensive series on [implementing in-app purchases in iOS applications](https://adapty.io/blog/in-app-purchase-tutorial-for-ios/).\\n\\n## What are the complete steps for iOS in-app purchase implementation?\\n\\nIf you haven’t read the previous articles, I recommend starting with:\\n\\n1. [iOS in-app purchases. part 1: App Store Connect and project configuration](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-set-up-ios-in-app-purchases/)\\n2. [iOS in-app purchases, part 2: purchase initialization and processing](https://adapty.io/blog/product-optimization-for-ios/)\\n3. [iOS in-app purchases, part 3: testing purchases in Xcode](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-test-ios-in-app-purchases/)\\n4. iOS in-app purchases, part 4: server-side transaction validation\\n5. [iOS in-app purchases, part 5: the list of SKError codes and how to handle them](https://adapty.io/blog/ios-skerrordomain-error-codes/)\\n\\nIn this guide, we’ll explore Apple’s latest server-side validation approach, explain how it works, and provide practical implementation examples to help you validate transactions and manage subscriptions efficiently.\\n\\n## Why did Apple replace verifyReceipt with App Store Server API?\\n\\nApple has significantly modernized their transaction validation system. The legacy `verifyReceipt` endpoint, which required parsing encrypted receipt files, has been deprecated in favor of the new [App Store Server API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi).\\n\\n### Key improvements\\n\\nThe new API delivers several compelling advantages:\\n\\n- **Simpler transaction verification**: Get clear, structured transaction data without manually parsing receipts.\\n- **Real-time subscription status**: Instantly check user subscription states.\\n- **Improved fraud prevention**: More secure validation with JWT-based authentication.\\n- **Simplified cross-platform support**: Easily manage user subscriptions across devices and platforms.\\n- **Better analytics and insights**: Clearer, more accurate transaction history and user subscription lifecycle events.\\n\\n## How does App Store Server API transaction validation work?\\n\\nThe typical validation workflow follows these steps:\\n\\n1. The user completes an in-app purchase on their device.\\n2. Your app receives the transaction information via StoreKit 2.\\n3. Your app securely sends transaction data (like `transactionId`) to your own server.\\n4. Your server authenticates using a signed JWT (JSON Web Token) and queries Apple’s App Store Server API.\\n5. Apple returns structured JSON responses containing transaction details and subscription statuses.\\n6. Your server confirms the purchase validity and grants access to premium features.\\n\\nThis architecture keeps sensitive validation logic on your server while maintaining a smooth user experience.\\n\\n## How do you set up JWT authentication for App Store Connect API?\\n\\nTo interact with the App Store Server API, you’ll first authenticate your requests using JWT. This is more secure than the older “shared secret” approach.\\n\\nYou’ll need the following:\\n\\n- Your Issuer ID – Found in App Store Connect under the User and Access menu, within the Integrations tab, and the App Store Connect API sub-tab\\n\\n![App Store Connect Users and Access page showing App Store Server API key generation interface with Team Keys and Individual Keys tabs](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/issuerID-1024x206.png)\\n\\n- A generated API Key (provide a name and set access to Developer)\\n\\n![App Store Server API generate Key dialog showing name field filled with \\\"Tutorial API key\\\" and Developer access level selected](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/generate-key-1024x483.png)\\n\\n- Once generated, copy the key ID and download the .p8 file\\n\\n⚠️ **Important**: Store your .p8 file securely as you cannot re-download it.\\n\\n![App Store Connect API key row showing \\\"Tutorial API key\\\" with Key ID \\\"4Q9PT78PJJ\\\" and Download button for .p8 file](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/download-key-1024x46.png)\\n\\nApple uses standard JWT tokens. Here’s how to generate a JWT token in Swift using JWTKit:\\n\\n```\\nimport JWTKit\\n\\nlet keyId = \\\"ABC123DEFG\\\"\\nlet issuerId = \\\"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\\\"\\nlet privateKey = \\\"<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENTS>\\\"\\n\\nlet signer = try JWTSigner.es256(key: .private(pem: privateKey))\\nlet payload = AppStorePayload(\\n    issuer: issuerId,\\n    issuedAt: Date(),\\n    expiration: Date().addingTimeInterval(60 * 5), // token valid for 5 minutes\\n    audience: \\\"appstoreconnect-v1\\\"\\n)\\n\\nlet jwt = try signer.sign(payload, header: [\\\"kid\\\": keyId])\\n```\\n\\n```\\nimport JWTKit\\n\\nlet keyId = \\\"ABC123DEFG\\\"\\nlet issuerId = \\\"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\\\"\\nlet privateKey = \\\"<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENTS>\\\"\\n\\nlet signer = try JWTSigner.es256(key: .private(pem: privateKey))\\nlet payload = AppStorePayload(\\n    issuer: issuerId,\\n    issuedAt: Date(),\\n    expiration: Date().addingTimeInterval(60 * 5), // token valid for 5 minutes\\n    audience: \\\"appstoreconnect-v1\\\"\\n)\\n\\nlet jwt = try signer.sign(payload, header: [\\\"kid\\\": keyId])\\n```\\n\\nYour JWT will be used as a Bearer token in your App Store Server API requests.\\n\\n## How do you validate iOS in-app purchase transactions with the API?\\n\\nTo validate a transaction, you should call the [following endpoint](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/get-transaction-info), replacing `{transactionId}` with the transaction ID you got from your app upon purchase by your user.\\n\\n```\\ncurl -X GET \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>\\\" \\\\\\n  \\\"https://api.storekit.itunes.apple.com/inApps/v1/transactions/{transactionId}\\\"\\n```\\n\\n```\\ncurl -X GET \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>\\\" \\\\\\n  \\\"https://api.storekit.itunes.apple.com/inApps/v1/transactions/{transactionId}\\\"\\n```\\n\\nNotice the use of the Bearer token we created in the previous step as the authorization header value.\\n\\nApple’s API should return a payload similar to the following, assuming that it finds the transaction ID you provided in the request:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"bundleId\\\": \\\"com.adapty.sample_app\\\",\\n  \\\"transactionId\\\": \\\"2000000112345678\\\",\\n  \\\"productId\\\": \\\"basic_subscription_monthly\\\",\\n  \\\"purchaseDate\\\": 1628533562000,\\n  \\\"originalTransactionId\\\": \\\"2000000112345678\\\",\\n  \\\"quantity\\\": 1,\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"Auto-Renewable Subscription\\\",\\n  \\\"inAppOwnershipType\\\": \\\"PURCHASED\\\",\\n  \\\"signedTransactionInfo\\\": \\\"<signed transaction data for additional security>\\\",\\n  \\\"environment\\\": \\\"Production\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"bundleId\\\": \\\"com.adapty.sample_app\\\",\\n  \\\"transactionId\\\": \\\"2000000112345678\\\",\\n  \\\"productId\\\": \\\"basic_subscription_monthly\\\",\\n  \\\"purchaseDate\\\": 1628533562000,\\n  \\\"originalTransactionId\\\": \\\"2000000112345678\\\",\\n  \\\"quantity\\\": 1,\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"Auto-Renewable Subscription\\\",\\n  \\\"inAppOwnershipType\\\": \\\"PURCHASED\\\",\\n  \\\"signedTransactionInfo\\\": \\\"<signed transaction data for additional security>\\\",\\n  \\\"environment\\\": \\\"Production\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nResponses you’re likely to encounter are:\\n\\n- Response code 200 – the request succeeded and the transaction was found\\n- Response code 401 – Your JWT is invalid\\n- Response code 404 – The transaction ID wasn’t found\\n\\nThe 401 indicates you may have created your JWT improperly. Check the related code and ensure it’s working correctly.\\n\\nThe 404 could indicate either an issue with how you’ve sent your transaction ID to the server from the app, or that the app has been compromised and the user is trying to access premium content fraudulently. It’s up to you how you wish to respond to this within your system and the app.\\n\\nIf you receive the transaction info, you can further confirm the validity of the data by inspecting the `signedTransactionInfo` key. The value is a JWS, or the JSON Web Signature Compact Serialization format. See this [Apple Doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/jwstransaction) for further information on parsing this value.\\n\\nThe presence of the transaction data payload indicates that Apple has validated it, and you are free to unlock premium features for your user.\\n\\n## How do you manage iOS subscriptions with App Store Server API?\\n\\nIf you’re focused on auto-renewable subscriptions, you can call a different endpoint to retrieve data about [all of a customer’s subscriptions in your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/get-all-subscription-statuses).\\n\\n```\\ncurl -X GET \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>\\\" \\\\\\n  \\\"https://api.storekit.itunes.apple.com/inApps/v1/subscriptions/{transactionId}\\\"\\n```\\n\\n```\\ncurl -X GET \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>\\\" \\\\\\n  \\\"https://api.storekit.itunes.apple.com/inApps/v1/subscriptions/{transactionId}\\\"\\n```\\n\\nYou would create and utilize a JWT in the same manner as with the previous endpoint.\\n\\nThis will return a payload of data with all the auto-renewable subscriptions the user has purchased from your app, including ones that are expired or refunded. If you wish to limit the results to certain types, you can append the request URL with multiple query parameters of the same type, like so:\\n\\n```\\nhttps://api.storekit.itunes.apple.com/inApps/v1/subscriptions/{transactionId}?status=1&status=4\\n```\\n\\n```\\nhttps://api.storekit.itunes.apple.com/inApps/v1/subscriptions/{transactionId}?status=1&status=4\\n```\\n\\nThe above would specifically filter for only the active (1) or billing grace period (4) statuses. These are the available statuses you can filter for:\\n\\n- 1 – subscription is active\\n- 2 – subscription is expired\\n- 3 – subscription is in a billing retry period\\n- 4 – subscription is in a billing grace period\\n- 5 – subscription has been revoked (refunded or revoked from family sharing)\\n\\nThe payload for this request would look something like the following, with subscription info grouped by the subscription group identifier it belongs to:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"bundleId\\\": \\\"com.adapty.sample_app\\\",\\n  \\\"environment\\\": \\\"Production\\\",\\n  \\\"data\\\": [\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\n      \\\"subscriptionGroupIdentifier\\\": \\\"272394410\\\",\\\\\\n      \\\"lastTransactions\\\": [\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\n          \\\"transactionId\\\": \\\"230001020690335\\\",\\\\\\n          \\\"status\\\": 1,\\\\\\n          \\\"signedTransactionInfo\\\": \\\"<signed transaction details>\\\"\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\n      ]\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"bundleId\\\": \\\"com.adapty.sample_app\\\",\\n  \\\"environment\\\": \\\"Production\\\",\\n  \\\"data\\\": [\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\n      \\\"subscriptionGroupIdentifier\\\": \\\"272394410\\\",\\\\\\n      \\\"lastTransactions\\\": [\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\n          \\\"transactionId\\\": \\\"230001020690335\\\",\\\\\\n          \\\"status\\\": 1,\\\\\\n          \\\"signedTransactionInfo\\\": \\\"<signed transaction details>\\\"\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\n      ]\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## How do you implement App Store Server notifications V2 webhooks?\\n\\nAs an alternative to the above endpoints, to get a continuous and real-time stream of subscription event data for your customers, you can set up [Apple’s Server Notifications V2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-v2) using a webhook. This will allow you to stay up to date without needing to wait for transaction IDs to be sent from the app after a user makes a purchase.\\n\\nCommon notification types include:\\n\\n- SUBSCRIBED: User successfully subscribed or renewed\\n- DID\\\\_FAIL\\\\_TO\\\\_RENEW: Renewal failed due to payment issues\\n- DID\\\\_CHANGE\\\\_RENEWAL\\\\_STATUS: User enabled or disabled auto-renewal\\n- REFUND: Subscription was refunded\\n\\nNotification payloads will look similar to the following:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"notificationType\\\": \\\"DID_RENEW\\\",\\n  \\\"subtype\\\": \\\"INITIAL_BUY\\\",\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"bundleId\\\": \\\"com.adapty.sample_app\\\",\\n    \\\"environment\\\": \\\"Production\\\",\\n    \\\"signedTransactionInfo\\\": \\\"<signed transaction details>\\\",\\n    \\\"signedRenewalInfo\\\": \\\"<signed renewal details>\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"notificationType\\\": \\\"DID_RENEW\\\",\\n  \\\"subtype\\\": \\\"INITIAL_BUY\\\",\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"bundleId\\\": \\\"com.adapty.sample_app\\\",\\n    \\\"environment\\\": \\\"Production\\\",\\n    \\\"signedTransactionInfo\\\": \\\"<signed transaction details>\\\",\\n    \\\"signedRenewalInfo\\\": \\\"<signed renewal details>\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhether you utilize the App Store Server API or the webhook approach, this process of transaction validation benefits from stronger security in the form of JWT authentication and JWS signed responses, structured endpoints to simplify error handling, and modern REST APIs to reduce complexity in your server code.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile you can implement App Store Server API validation from scratch, managing the full complexity of subscription analytics, revenue optimization, and cross-platform compatibility can be time-consuming.\\n\\n**Adapty provides a comprehensive solution that handles:**\\n\\n- Automated server-side validation and webhook management\\n- Advanced subscription analytics and cohort analysis\\n- A/B testing for pricing and paywalls\\n- Revenue optimization insights\\n- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)\\n\\n**Get started today:**\\n\\n[Schedule a personalized walkthrough](https://adapty.io/schedule-demo) with our team or [begin implementing](https://app.adapty.io/registration) in minutes with our developer-friendly SDK.\\n\\n**Questions?** Contact our team at [support@adapty.io](mailto:support@adapty.io) or check out our [documentation](https://adapty.io/docs/quickstart) to see how Adapty can accelerate your subscription business growth.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Here’s an overview of the potential drawbacks of each.\\n\\n### Cons of Flutter\\n\\n- **Large application size:** Flutter apps tend to have larger file sizes compared to native apps. This is partly because Flutter requires embedding both the Dart runtime and the Flutter engine into the app. Large file sizes can be a significant drawback, especially for users in regions with limited storage or slower internet connections.\\n- **Less native performance:** While Flutter’s performance is generally comparable to native apps, it can lag in more complex scenarios involving extensive use of device hardware or sophisticated interaction with the underlying OS. This is due to the abstraction layer that Flutter uses to maintain compatibility across platforms.\\n- **Reliance on Dart**: Flutter’s exclusive reliance on Dart means that developers need to learn and adapt to a language that, outside of the Flutter ecosystem, is not widely used. This can limit the transferability of skills and may deter some developers who prefer more commonly used languages.\\n- **UI-Centric:** While Flutter excels in UI development, it may not be as straightforward when dealing with background processing or when extensive interaction with the operating system is required. These scenarios often require additional plugins or custom native code, complicating the development process.\\n- **Young Ecosystem:** Although rapidly growing, Flutter’s ecosystem is relatively young compared to more established frameworks like React Native or native development environments. This can sometimes result in fewer third-party libraries or encountering bugs that have not yet been addressed by the community.\\n\\n### Cons of Kotlin\\n\\n- **Slower compilation time**: Kotlin generally has a slower compilation time compared to some other languages, such as Java. This can affect developer productivity, especially in large projects where build times significantly impact the iteration cycle.\\n- **Learning curve**: For developers not familiar with modern programming concepts like lambdas, coroutines, and higher-order functions, Kotlin’s advanced features can represent a steep learning curve. This complexity can initially slow down development as teams adapt to Kotlin’s concise but dense coding style.\\n- **Limited native support beyond Android**: While Kotlin Multi platform is making strides in supporting iOS and other platforms, it’s still primarily seen as an Android-first language. The tooling and support for other platforms, particularly in UI development, are not as mature as for Android, complicating true cross-platform development efforts.\\n- **Interoperability overhead**: Although Kotlin is designed to interoperate seamlessly with Java, there can be overheads, especially when using features not present in Java. This can lead to increased memory usage and runtime costs, which might affect performance in resource-constrained environments.\\n- **Community and resources:** While growing, the Kotlin community is still smaller than those for Java or other mainstream languages, which may affect the availability of learning resources and third-party libraries for non-Android applications.\\n\\nBoth Flutter and Kotlin have their specific areas where they excel and others where they face challenges. You should consider these cons in the context of your project’s requirements, the skill set of your development team, and the specific goals you aim to achieve.\\n\\n## Flutter vs. Kotlin: Which one is better in 2026?\\n\\nAs we’ve discussed throughout this article, both Flutter and Kotlin have unique strengths and cater to different development needs in 2026. Flutter, with its fast UI rendering, native performance, and hot reload feature, is an excellent choice for cross-platform development, rapid prototyping, and creating UI-intensive applications. Its rich widget library and strong community support further enhance its appeal, particularly for startups and small teams aiming to maximize efficiency with a single codebase.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Kotlin shines in scenarios where Android development is the primary focus. Its seamless interoperability with Java, concise syntax, and modern features make it a powerful tool for building reliable and efficient applications. Kotlin’s multi platform capabilities, while still evolving, offer promising opportunities for sharing code across different platforms, although it may require more effort in UI development compared to Flutter.\\n\\nIn the end, what to choose between Flutter and Kotlin depends on your specific project requirements and team expertise. If you need a versatile, cross-platform solution with a focus on beautiful, responsive UIs, Flutter is the way to go. If you’re targeting robust Android development or leveraging existing Java resources, Kotlin will serve you well. Both languages are open-source and cost-effective, making them excellent options for modern app development. Whichever you choose, you’ll be well-equipped to create high-quality applications in 2026. Happy coding!\\n\\n## Key Takeaways:\\n\\n- **Cross-Platform Efficiency**: Flutter allows for writing code once and deploying it on multiple platforms, saving time and resources.\\n- **Native Android Focus:** Kotlin is ideal for Android development, offering seamless integration with Java and modern language features.\\n- **Rapid Prototyping**: Flutter’s hot reload feature speeds up development, making it perfect for quickly iterating on ideas.\\n- **UI Flexibility**: Flutter provides a rich set of widgets for creating customizable and visually appealing interfaces.\\n- **Community and Support**: Both Flutter and Kotlin have strong community support, but Flutter’s ecosystem is especially beneficial for cross-platform projects.\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### What is the main difference between Flutter and Kotlin?\\n\\nFlutter is a cross-platform UI framework that uses Dart to build apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Kotlin is a modern programming language primarily used for native Android apps and, through Kotlin Multiplatform, shared business logic across platforms.\\n\\n### Can Flutter and Kotlin Multiplatform be used for cross-platform development?\\n\\nYes. Flutter is designed for cross-platform UI with a single codebase. Kotlin Multiplatform allows sharing business logic across platforms, but UI is typically native per platform.\\n\\n### Which one has better performance on Android?\\n\\nKotlin generally provides native performance on Android because it compiles directly to native code. Flutter offers near-native performance but sits on an abstraction layer for rendering UI.\\n\\n### Which is easier to learn for web or mobile developers?\\n\\nFlutter requires learning Dart and the widget-oriented architecture, which can be new. Kotlin might be easier for developers with Java/Android experience because of its concise syntax and interoperability.\\n\\n### Which ecosystem has more third-party support?\\n\\nFlutter has a large and active ecosystem with many packages via Pub. Kotlin has excellent support in Android tooling and libraries, especially for Android-specific features.\\n\\n### Is UI creation easier in Flutter or Kotlin?\\n\\nFlutter has a unified, rich widget library that makes UI creation consistent across platforms. Kotlin relies on platform-native UI frameworks like Jetpack Compose for Android and other tools for iOS, leading to more platform-specific UI work.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

And honestly, it’s not too different from actual plant parenting: a little sunlight (trust), a bit of water (value), and sometimes moving the pot around (pricing tests) can make all the difference.\\n\\n![Paywall Newsletter Expert](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/Paywall-Newsletter-expert-1024x288.webp)\\n\\nTo help us break it all down, we invited **[Ngozi Ogbonna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ogbonna/).** She has spent years growing subscription products (and a few real plants along the way). So their take on what makes a paywall thrive is rooted in both data and real-life growth stories.\\n\\n## **PictureThis – Plant Identifier**\\n\\n_Last month revenue: $8M \\\\| Last month downloads: 900K_\\n\\n![PictureThis Paywall](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/PictureThis-paywall-scaled.webp)\\n\\n![PictureThispaywall](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/PictureThispaywall.gif)\\n\\n### **What’s blooming**\\n\\n- The trial reminder option reassures users the trial is truly “risk-free.”\\n- High average ratings and a large number of reviews add strong social proof and build trust.\\n- If the main goal is to drive more trial starts, the free trial option is well-designed and positioned to encourage conversions..\\n\\n### **What’s worth testing**\\n\\n- Try clearer copy that highlights key features to better show the app’s value.\\n- The monthly plan currently looks cheaper than yearly. Testing other lengths might guide more users toward yearly.\\n- Adding visuals — like a healthy plant or an image of the product diagnosing a plant photo — could reinforce the value proposition.\\n\\n→ _We covered other smart ways apps use trial reminders in_ [_Paywall Newsletter #22: Calorie Counter Apps_](https://adapty.io/blog/paywall-newsletter-22/) _._\\n\\n## **Plant App: Plant Identifier**\\n\\n_Last month revenue: $200K_ \\\\| _Last month downloads: 30K_\\n\\n![Plant App paywall](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/Plant-App-scaled.webp)\\n\\n![PlantApp paywall](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/PlantApp.gif)\\n\\n### **What’s working well**\\n\\n- The before/after plant animation shows the benefit clearly.\\n- The lifetime plan is featured as the hero and highlights strong value.\\n- The trial reminder option helps build trust.\\n\\n### **What’s worth testing**\\n\\n- Try alternative copy: “Try for free” appears twice and could be replaced with product features.\\n- Compare LTV of lifetime vs weekly users to see if the pricing mix is right. Testing different trial lengths (weekly, monthly, yearly) might reveal more value.\\n- Offering the discounted lifetime plan as a limited promo for lapsed or undecided users could be worth exploring.\\n\\n## Plantify: AI Plant Identifier\\n\\n_Last month revenue: $80K_ \\\\| _Last month downloads: 8K_\\n\\n![Plantify](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/Plantify-scaled.webp)\\n\\n![Plantify](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/Plantify.gif)\\n\\n### **What’s working well**\\n\\n- Visuals + listed benefits make the value clear.\\n- The free trial is highlighted and easy to spot.\\n- The yearly plan is marked as best offer with weekly breakdowns shown.\\n- “No payment now” badge reassures users starting a trial.\\n\\n### **What’s worth testing**\\n\\n- Make the yearly plan the true hero, with a stronger “best offer” badge.\\n- Try offering the free trial on yearly, while making weekly secondary.\\n- If onboarding gathers user interests, test tailoring paywall copy and benefits to match for a more personalized pitch.\\n\\n## Planto: Plant Identifier\\n\\n_Last month revenue: $100K_ \\\\| _Last month downloads: 40K_\\n\\n![Planto](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/Planto-scaled.webp)\\n\\n### **What’s working well**\\n\\n- Benefits are outlined clearly in bold text, so users know exactly what they get.\\n- The trial reminder toggle reassures users who might be hesitant.\\n\\n### **What’s worth testing**\\n\\n- Add social proof (ratings, reviews, or user quotes) to support the “Recommended by our users” claim.\\n- Try new design versions: stronger CTAs, cleaner layout, and more visible plan buttons.\\n- Explore extra pricing options (monthly, yearly) to give users more choice and potentially lift revenue.\\n\\n## **Takeaway**\\n\\nPlant care apps remind us: growth = trust + the right container. Trial reminders lower the barrier, while thoughtful packaging helps users choose confidently. A few tweaks in design and copy could make these paywalls blossom even more. 🌸\\n\\nAnd hey — even if you don’t have a green thumb, remember: testing is the real fertilizer.\\n\\n[![Subscribe To Paywall Newsletter](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/Subscribe-to-Paywall-Newsletter-1024x416.webp)](https://adapty.io/paywall-newsletter/)\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

vs. React Native: Which framework is better for your project?\\n\\nMarch 21, 2024\\n\\nby\\n\\n[![](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/avatar-disha-sharma.webp)](https://adapty.io/author/disha-sharma/)\\n\\n[Disha Sharma](https://adapty.io/author/disha-sharma/)\\n\\nMarch 21, 2024\\n\\n15 min read\\n\\n![Flutter Vs React Native](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/flutter-vs-react-native.png)\\n\\nFlutter and React Native are two of the [most popular cross-platform mobile app development frameworks.](https://adapty.io/blog/mobile-app-development-frameworks/)\\n\\nBacked by Google and Meta, these open-source frameworks let you use a single codebase to deliver native app experiences across Android, iOS, and the web ecosystems. By letting you reuse your code across your different app environments, they reduce your development costs. They also let you ship new features more quickly to all your target platforms as they need less coding than native app development. As a result, your ongoing maintenance reduces, too.\\n\\nBut which is the better platform between Flutter and React Native? There are several considerations when choosing between Flutter and React Native for building a cross-platform app. In this guide, we’ll explore these in detail. But first, here are quick overviews of both the frameworks.\\n\\n## What is Flutter?\\n\\nLaunched in 2017, Google’s open-source multiplatform mobile app development framework, [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [wants](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview) to enable you _“to deliver high-performance apps that feel natural on different platforms, embracing differences where they exist while sharing as much code as possible.”_ Flutter has come a long way to become the cross-platform framework of choice for developers who want to build apps that feel native everywhere:\\n\\n- On phones (even foldable phones!) running any OS (Android or iOS)\\n- Across the web (inside any browser and even when it’s cast to a large HD TV monitor)\\n- On desktops running any OS (Windows, MacOS, or Linux)\\n\\nBecause Flutter is a multiplatform framework, you only need to write a single codebase, and delivering native app experiences across all these ecosystems becomes possible directly from it. However, because as a mobile app maker, Android and iOS are two of your most essential target platforms, Flutter offers built-in support for both Material and Cupertino design systems.\\n\\nThe keyword when talking about the Flutter Framework is “adaptive.” Flutter lets you build apps that adapt to any device they’re accessed on.\\n\\nFrom publishers like the New York Times to eCommerce giants like Alibaba and SaaS businesses like Square, all kinds of companies use Flutter to power their apps. While over a million apps use Google’s Flutter framework, Google’s own Google Pay app might just be the framework’s most popular app.\\n\\n## What is React Native?\\n\\nLaunched in 2015, [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is Facebook’s open-source multiplatform app development framework. It was built on top of its React project to help deliver native app experiences on iOS and Android devices using a single codebase. React Native is the second most widely used cross-platform development Framework after Flutter.\\n\\nLike Flutter, you can use React Native to deliver apps that feel natural on a host of ecosystems (mobiles, desktops, and the web).\\n\\nWhile Flutter has grown in popularity in the past few years, React Native has maintained its hold too. In fact, the React Native community is excited about the framework’s much-awaited “New Architecture.” Currently available experimentally, this update has the framework moving away from its legacy bridge-based way of working to a more modern bridgeless mode.\\n\\nFacebook uses React Native to power parts of its mobile app. Like Flutter, React Native is popular in all kinds of industries. Everyone from etailers like Amazon and Flipkart to consumer apps and tech businesses like Microsoft uses React Native to power their cross-platform apps.\\n\\nLet’s now see how Flutter and React Native compare in different areas, such as their programming languages, approaches to UI, ease of learning and adoption, performance, security, and more, so you can choose the best option for your project.\\n\\n## Flutter vs. React Native\\n\\n### Programming Languages\\n\\nReact Native uses Javascript, a language that all mobile developers are familiar with and love. Familiarity with Javascript has, in fact, been one of the main drivers pushing React Native’s adoption for cross-platform apps.\\n\\nFlutter, in contrast, uses Dart – a programming language from Google. Many developers considering the Flutter framework see learning and using Dart as a challenge. However, learning Dart is more accessible than most realize, as Dart is similar to C# and Java.\\n\\nGoogle went with Dart for Flutter because it wanted a language that could deliver high performance. And Dart is designed for performance with features like strong typing. Also, Dart is a compiled language in contrast to Javascript, which is an interpreted language, meaning Dart will generally outperform Javascript every time in performance parameters like speed. By the way both iOS and Android support compiled languages (Swift and Kotlin, respectively) as their official languages for reasons like speed and performance.\\n\\n### Ease of learning\\n\\nJavascript is ubiquitous, and that reflects when mobile teams choose their cross-platform framework. For example, suppose you’ve got a team of expert Javascript developers onboard and want to migrate to a cross-platform framework. In that case, you might just go with React Native. You have all the expertise you need.\\n\\nAlso, if you’re familiar with Javascript, you’re familiar with the entire ecosystem of frameworks, libraries, SDKs, and other stuff that works seamlessly with it. This means building a native app by tapping the Javascript ecosystem is already easy for you.\\n\\nChoosing Flutter would mean investing time and resources in learning Dart. When Google decided to try Flutter for its Google Pay app, it had to make more hires in addition to retraining its engineers.\\n\\nAlso, because Flutter doesn’t come with a rich ecosystem like Javascript, you might also need time for building workarounds when you fail to find ready-to-use stuff. So, there’s a learning phase here. That said, this process should be expedited if you can find the right building blocks for your app in the Flutter ecosystem.\\n\\n### Cross Platform-ness\\n\\n**UI rendering**\\n\\nTo a large extent, UI rendering determines whether your cross-platform app feels native on your target platforms. Both React Native and Flutter do well here.\\n\\nWith React Native’s bridge architecture, an app’s Javascript code runs in a separate Javascript engine and communicates with a native platform’s components over a bridge (a sort of a communication layer). React Native uses this bridge architecture to use native platform components to render its cross-platform app’s UI.  Because React Native uses a target ecosystem’s native components for delivering UI, its apps feel (naturally) “natural.”\\n\\nFlutter, on the other hand, completely bypasses a native platform’s UI elements and directly renders the app’s UI using its widgets (UI components). Flutter directly renders these widgets to the target ecosystem without relying on native UI components. Flutter’s rendering not only offers designers and developers the flexibility they need to build their apps but can also deliver pixel-perfect designs on all target platforms.\\n\\n**Delivering apps that look native**\\n\\nWith React Native, you can define platform-specific styling for your UI elements for all your target platforms. So you can specify how a particular app component should behave on Android and iOS.  Flutter also lets you define platform-specific themes to style your UI elements differently for Android and iOS versions. Flutter also offers platform-aware widgets that automatically adapt to the ecosystem they’re launched on.\\n\\n**Platform-specific behaviors**\\n\\nThings like scrolling behave very differently on Android and iOS devices. And that’s why, for a cross-platform app to feel native, the underlying framework must get these platform-specific behaviors right. Here, too, both React Native and Flutter offer comparable performance. Both come with mechanisms to let you handle ecosystem-specific features and functionalities.\\n\\n### Performance\\n\\nRegarding performance, Flutter seems to have the edge over React Native. This loops back to the languages they use. Flutter uses Dart, which supports ahead-of-time compilation. So, Flutter apps start up noticeably quicker, as the native code it compiles for the different target platforms doesn’t need any interpreting in runtime. React Native’s Javascript, on the other hand, tends to add overhead here as it’s an interpreted language, and the interpretation process that happens at runtime adds overhead.\\n\\nYou can optimize Javascript’s performance with just-in-time compilation optimization, but this still requires work. With Dart (Flutter), you get a head start here.\\n\\nThat said, your Flutter or React Native app’s performance depends on more than just the language of its underlying framework. How you code, the runtime environment, and the optimizations you use affect your app’s performance. With the correct coding and optimizations, you can get both to deliver comparable performance.\\n\\n### Security\\n\\nBoth frameworks can handle secure HTTP requests to facilitate communications between apps and servers.  Both also offer secure storage. Flutter lets you encrypt your user app data for storage on the user’s device using Flutter’s secure storage packages, whereas React Native comes with libraries like the react-native-keychain that let you do the same. Both Flutter and React Native also come with third-party solutions for the same.\\n\\nLikewise, when it comes to authentication, again, both Flutter and React Native work similarly, using protocols like OAuth 2.0 and JWT.\\n\\nCode obfuscation is also supported in each.\\n\\nOverall, both frameworks have all the security mechanisms in place. In this area, your app’s security really comes down to how secure you build it.\\n\\n### Testing and debugging\\n\\nThanks to the React Native ecosystem, you get dozens of testing libraries and frameworks to run all kinds of testing (like unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, component testing, and user interaction testing) on your React Native cross-platform app.  Flutter, too, comes with robust testing support. You can use Flutter’s built-in Flutter testing framework/library for testing your app. This library supports unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests. Both frameworks also support a host of tools to facilitate testing and debugging.\\n\\n### Packages, libraries, and plugins\\n\\nOne benefit of using frameworks for building your cross-platform app is that you don’t need to code from scratch. For many of your app’s features and functionalities, you can simply use reusable code (like plugins) and build upon it. This speeds up your app-building process. And that’s why the availability of the “ready-to-use” building blocks remains an important consideration when choosing between Flutter and React Native. It directly impacts how quickly you can build your app.\\n\\nReact Native already has a very mature ecosystem. It doesn’t matter what kind of an app you want to build or its industry. The chances are that you can find tested building blocks for your use case in React Native’s ecosystem. So it gets easy to put together your app. That said, with the impending New Architecture, many of the current ecosystem resources might need significant updates. So, at least, for now, many of these resources may not be ready to deploy for apps planning to use the soon-to-be-released upgrade.\\n\\nFlutter’s ecosystem is growing. It will take time before it scales to resemble the React Native ecosystem.\\n\\n### Ecosystems\\n\\nLet’s talk about Flutter first.\\n\\nThe increasing interest in Flutter reflects in how its ecosystem is expanding. Last year alone, [Flutter’s ecosystem grew by 26%](https://medium.com/flutter/progress-of-the-flutter-package-ecosystem-17cded9a0703). More packages mean more ready-to-use stuff to build your app… which means you can put together your cross-platform app really quickly:\\n\\n![Flutter ecosystem growth](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flutter-ecosystem-growth.png)\\n\\nReact Native, though, is the clear winner here. If you need something to build your app, it’s probably available.\\n\\n### Documentation\\n\\nBoth Flutter and React Native offer all the guidance you need to build your cross-platform apps using them. From getting started guides to illustrated tutorials, sample code, and best practices, both frameworks enable you to write your best code. Both frameworks also offer thorough documentation on areas like app testing and optimization.\\n\\nMany developers, too, independently contribute a lot of content around both frameworks. The answers you need are likely already available. You may find Flutter’s documentation to be more structured, though.\\n\\nQuick links:\\n\\n- [Flutter’s documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)\\n- [React Native’s documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)\\n\\n### Development cost\\n\\nWhile building cross-platform apps with both Flutter and React Native will take considerably fewer resources than building and maintaining native apps, doing a general cost analysis of building an app with Flutter versus building it with React Native is difficult. However, here are some considerations.\\n\\n**First comes the availability of development resources.** If you go with React Native, it will be a little easier for you to hire talented developers for your project. On the other hand, Flutter (and Dart) developers who know the ins and outs of using the Flutter platform can be challenging to source. For this same reason, Flutter development might cost you more.\\n\\nIt’s best to pay a Flutter or React Native consultant for a consultation to understand what costs you’d be actually looking at.\\n\\n**Next comes the availability of all the ready-to-use stuff to build your project.** We touched upon this in the earlier section on the ecosystems for both the frameworks. To reiterate, depending on the kind of app you’re building, you might be able to find dozens of ready-to-use plugins in the React Native ecosystem, which won’t just bring down your development time but also costs. Finding comparable options, if they exist, in the Flutter ecosystem can be a little pricey. If you’ve got a web app that uses React, then React Native may be your natural choice to build a cost-effective cross-platform app, as you can find a lot of read-to-deploy stuff.\\n\\n**Finally, there are ongoing development and maintenance costs to consider.** Remember to factor in your ongoing development and maintenance costs when you analyze costs. Flutter may prove to be a more cost-effective option in this respect.\\n\\n### Community support\\n\\nReact Native was already an established cross-platform framework by the time Flutter started. And so it had a bigger community when Futter just started. A big reason for this was also that React Native uses Javascript, which itself has a huge following. While Flutter was launched later and took its time to gain traction, it now has a bigger community than React Native, at least on Twitter.\\n\\nConversations on developer platforms like Stack Overflow are also increasingly about Flutter and noticeably less about React Native. This [chart](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=flutter%2Creact-native) from Stack Overflow also communicates Flutter’s growing popularity:\\n\\n![flutter vs react native stack overflow](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/flutter-vs-react-native-stack-overflow.png)\\n\\n## The future of Flutter and React Native\\n\\nIf you compare the momentum around these cross-platform development frameworks, you’ll find that the developer community is moving toward Flutter. From support from the principal backers and updates to the overall community sentiment, Flutter looks like the more promising alternative.\\n\\nTry looking for migration case studies ( _Native to X platform_), and you’ll see all the recent stories are “Flutter stories.” Most businesses that moved to Flutter recently also say that they did consider React Native but then opted for Flutter, given how it’s “future-proofed.” Flutter has the edge here.\\n\\nThat also explains why Google has invested in a thorough “ [Flutter for React Native Devs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/flutter-for/react-native-devs)” content hub. Flutter even has a “development roadmap” for 2024, which is rare for an open-source project!\\n\\nHere’s [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fg%2F11h03gfxy9,%2Fg%2F11f03_rzbg) showing how the two platforms compare. As you can see, Flutter is consistently doing better than React Native (though React Native was there first and remained popular while Flutter was still in its nascent stages):\\n\\n![Screenshot 2024 03 20 7.07.28 AM](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-7.07.28-AM.png)\\n\\nAll that said, React Native is still strong.\\n\\nIt’s also working on significant updates. React Native is in the process of introducing a bridgeless architecture—something the community has been asking for a long time. With this latest upgrade, which is currently in the experimental phase, React Native can interest many businesses still exploring their options. But this isn’t without its challenges. Once the update is production-ready, migrating existing apps and the entire React Native ecosystem to it will come with its challenges.\\n\\nAnother huge strength of the React Native platform is its mature ecosystem, which already has the building blocks for applications across a host of industries. As Flutter’s ecosystem evolves, the competition between the two platforms will only increase.\\n\\nThanks to the ubiquitous Javascript, it’s also much easier to build a cross-platform app using React Native than with Flutter. Flutter’s learning curve can be a challenge if you’re looking to launch something sooner.\\n\\nAll in all, both frameworks will continue to coexist with their share of takers.\\n\\n## Flutter vs. React Native: Which one should you go with?\\n\\nIf you’re looking to build a kind of future-proof multiplatform app using a single codebase – and if you aren’t tied to a React-powered tech stack for your existing web app (if you have one) – you might just go with Flutter. Of course, this is subject to the availability of Dart development resources.\\n\\nAnd if you’re already using React for your web-based app, React Native can be a natural choice for building your iOS and Android apps, as doing so will simplify your coding and maintenance (thanks to a single codebase powered by React).\\n\\n## Wrapping it up…\\n\\nAs you just saw when comparing Flutter and React Native, there’s no definitive right answer. That’s because every app project is different. Project specificities—everything from the budget and timeline to the available technical expertise—must be weighed in when choosing one.\\n\\nBut now you know the things you need to consider when making your choice!\\n\\nAlso, while you’re building your new cross-platform app or reengineering your existing native ones, do check out Adapty.

Optimize for **subscription revenue**, not just installs. Most “cheap” keywords deliver tire-kickers, while “expensive” ones often bring paying users._\\n\\nApple Ads remains [one of the most effective ways to acquire high-intent users for iOS apps](https://adapty.io/blog/top-reasons-mobile-app-users-go-from-freemium-to-premium). With over 600 million weekly App Store visitors, it’s where users are literally one tap away from downloading your app. But most developers face a critical gap: connecting ad spend to actual revenue.\\n\\nWhile Apple’s dashboard shows installs and clicks, it doesn’t reveal which keywords drive paying subscribers versus non-converting users. This guide covers everything you need to know about Apple Ads and how to solve the attribution gap that’s costing you profitable growth.\\n\\n## What is Apple Ads?\\n\\n**Apple Ads** is Apple’s official advertising platform for the App Store. It offers two distinct solutions designed for different stages of your growth:\\n\\n- Apple Ads Basic\\n- Apple Ads Advanced\\n\\nLet’s dive into both, starting with Apple Ads Basic.\\n\\n## Apple Ads Basic\\n\\n_Best for_: Beginners testing App Store advertising potential.\\n\\nApple Ads Basic is a fully managed solution: you set a budget and let Apple handle the rest.\\n\\n![Screenshot of the Apple Ads Basic interface on a laptop screen, showing the “Promote an App” setup page where users can select an app, choose countries or regions, enter a monthly budget, and set a maximum cost-per-install (CPI). The preview ad displays a sample app called Sprint Pacer.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2022/12/promote_an_app_with_apple_ads_basic-1024x652.webp)\\n\\n### Key features:\\n\\n- Cost-per-install (CPI) pricing. You only pay when someone downloads your app\\n- Single ad placement. Ads appear only at the top of search results\\n- Maximum 50 apps per account\\n- Monthly budget cap: $15,000 per app\\n\\nLimitations: No keyword control, limited targeting, and basic reporting that ends at the install.\\n\\n### Apple Ads Basic: 3-step setup\\n\\n#### Step 1: Choose your countries/regions\\n\\nChoose your battlefield: promote globally across all available markets or focus on specific high-value regions.\\n\\nPro tip: Start narrow. Pick 3-5 countries where your app already performs well organically. You can always expand once you identify winning markets.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Set a monthly budget\\n\\nSet your monthly investment ceiling, anywhere from $100 to $15,000 per app.\\n\\nBudget flexibility rules:\\n\\n- Scaling up → Increase anytime to capture more opportunities\\n- Scaling down → Changes only take effect next calendar month (Apple needs time to adjust pacing)\\n\\n_If you’re ready to invest more than $15,000 monthly per app, Apple Ads Advanced removes all budget restrictions and unlocks advanced targeting._\\n\\n#### Step 3: Set a max CPI\\n\\nThe max CPI is the maximum amount that you’d spend to get an [app install](https://adapty.io/glossary/app-installs-and-uninstalls/). And this is where most beginners stumble. Your maximum CPI determines your competitive positioning in Apple’s auction system.\\n\\nThe platform analyzes your app category, competitor bids, and historical performance to suggest optimal CPIs. Ignore this at your own risk.\\n\\nApple continuously refines suggestions based on:\\n\\n- Seasonal trends\\n- Real-time competitor activity\\n- Your app’s conversion performance\\n- Market demand fluctuations\\n\\nStart with Apple’s suggested CPI or 10-20% higher. Lower bids = fewer impressions. Higher bids = more visibility but watch your unit economics.\\n\\n### What Apple Ads Basic automates\\n\\n_No keyword research needed._ Apple matches your ads to relevant searches using your App Store listing, app category, and similar successful apps.\\n\\n_Zero creative work_. Ads auto-generate from your existing App Store assets. This makes [Apple Ads optimization](https://adapty.io/apple-ads-manager) crucial, your listing IS your ad creative.\\n\\n_[Custom Product Pages](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/custom-product-pages/) amplify performance._ Create up to 35 variations with different screenshots, videos, and messaging. Apple tests these automatically to find your best-converting combination.\\n\\n### The hidden limitation\\n\\nHere’s what Apple Ads Basic won’t tell you: you’re optimizing blind.\\n\\nApple shows you got 100 installs at $3.50 CPI, but doesn’t reveal:\\n\\n- How many started trials\\n- Which users became paying subscribers\\n- Your actual return on ad spend\\n- Lifetime value by user cohort\\n\\nAs aresult, you might pause “expensive” keywords that actually deliver your highest-value subscribers while scaling “cheap” keywords that bring tire-kickers.\\n\\n_Fix it:_ Connect Apple Ads Basic to revenue attribution (like [Adapty](https://adapty.io/)) to see which campaigns drive real business growth.\\n\\n![Dashboard view of Adapty Ads Manager showing Apple Ads campaign performance, including campaign names, status, CPT bid type, targeted countries, daily budgets, spend, revenue, and ROAS. Example data includes campaigns targeting Japan and the United States with varying spend and return on ad spend metrics.](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2022/12/Adapty_ads_manager.webp)\\n\\n## 10 steps to set up Apple Ads Advanced\\n\\n_Best for:_ Growth teams ready for granular control, unlimited budgets, and comprehensive App Store coverage.\\n\\nApple Ads Advanced transforms your advertising from basic search placements to complete App Store domination. Using a cost-per-tap (CPT) pricing model, you only pay when users actively engage with your ads.\\n\\nWith Advanced, you can promote unlimited apps without the $15,000 monthly budget cap. More importantly, you gain granular control over every aspect of your campaigns from precise keyword bidding to advanced audience targeting.\\n\\n_The setup process is comprehensive but powerful. Here’s your complete roadmap:_\\n\\n### **Step 1: Ad placements**\\n\\nYour first critical decision determines where your ads appear across the App Store ecosystem. Apple Ads Advanced offers four prime advertising real estate options:\\n\\n#### Today tab\\n\\nWhen users tap the App Store icon, they land here first, making this the most visited section of the entire platform. [Today tab ads](https://ads.apple.com/app-store/help/ad-placements/0083-today-tab) capture users in discovery mode, perfect for building awareness and driving impulse downloads.\\n\\n_Best for:_ Brand building, seasonal campaigns, and reaching users who aren’t actively searching yet.\\n\\n![iPhone screen displaying an example of a Today tab ad on the App Store. The ad appears prominently at the top of the Today section, featuring a promoted app called TripTrek with a “GET” button, designed to capture users in discovery mode before they begin searching.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/63a456890bd70633668c5f17_jmrom01daddsmfl-e_rf5um925614s8e4w5r5bl4joqdl2uleb0zcmhfbg0wfnd4iqmlcghpc-gn2rcsyo0etly2hcpaepmspw-zyg1pfoymoxjd9haovhlawz75lgx_aola88580iir-hk-ynvk-gwc6_zrl5mu3aqlewr5htv0puffhxcgi6q6ok_v1w.png)\\n\\n#### **Search tab**\\n\\nOver 70% of App Store visitors use search functionality. [Search tab ads](https://searchads.apple.com/help/ad-placements/0071-search-tab) appear in the “Suggested” section before users even start typing, letting you capture high-intent traffic at the perfect moment.\\n\\n_Best for:_ Intercepting users with search intent and competitive conquest campaigns.\\n\\n![iPhone screen showing Apple Search Ads in the Search tab placement. The ad appears in the “Suggested” section below the search bar, featuring promoted apps like TripTrek, Word Search, and Cake Building with “GET” buttons, visible before the user enters a search query.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/63a45689cbe18fbd30dbd68e_1yzixvkuoixjofjnkhgyueju62zriukpkkokzuar-exhnr3csnmkodx7yyrd4zhi5daljdkphmrgycplrzz9hm3ray2s-jbzpxn4npi1e0byzb4mw7u4aulhsxvcp6h5-iyay-rnojb-oberc4fe58azr7e5g2ahl2btbaciq7sutrscekdx_baba8iiww.png)\\n\\n#### Search results\\n\\nApple reports that 65% of app downloads happen directly after an [App Store search](https://searchads.apple.com/help/ad-placements/0082-search-results). This placement puts your ads above organic results when users search for your target keywords, the same functionality available in Apple Ads Basic, but with full customization control.\\n\\n_Best for:_ Keyword-driven acquisition and protecting branded search terms.\\n\\n![iPhone screen displaying Apple Ads in the App Store search results for the query “travel fitness.” A sponsored app, TripTrek, appears at the top with a “GET” button and preview images, followed by organic results such as Get Fit Local. This placement highlights keyword-based Apple Ads targeting.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/63a4568a308826a9f1fefc53_f4ecae9qxremnfdgjkkek-vh2zzwt1ogcezmoiopkddwjan1ncsabivbuddu72vuwyvxv1libixysijgt-emk_p4vhsl3yt5dcdkfl06udsxqvvkssljarhittfkcwvm1hpnpqxkt6l-qkdxogrtei0pqtpri-vfek1m9vqk_rqu-oo4vr5zoxjp3tktmg.png)\\n\\n#### Product pages\\n\\nShow your ads directly on competitors’ [app listing pages](https://searchads.apple.com/help/ad-placements/0084-product-pages.html). This placement captures users at the moment they’re evaluating alternatives, giving you a final chance to steal conversions.\\n\\n_Best for_: Competitive conquest and category expansion strategies.\\n\\n![iPhone screen displaying an example of Apple Ads Product Page placement. The ad for the TripTrek app appears under the “You Might Also Like” section on a competitor’s App Store listing, with a “GET” button and an “Ad” label, showcasing Apple’s competitive conquest ad strategy.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/63a4568a6ccbdb20e04a159f_v4um1jrcfgfflsfvomfnob9ambokdb9onb9marvfgz_idf0ohusgy806ibuy6wjmugprpgb6schlwx0yccfuqm6u_70vjveuvi9v39je7_aodcjtzgfxbkcsmuaqx7ww7gg7u8ciq08lngt0ywixacxdbk4kzrx4a3douy9kiuu1xsbrqzvvvixbwzrgma.png)\\n\\n### Step 2: Geographic targeting & market strategy\\n\\nOnce you’ve selected ad placements, define where your ads will run. Apple Ads Advanced allows intelligent location grouping for streamlined campaign management.\\n\\n_Pro strategy_: Group similar markets together (like clustering all European countries) to simplify bid management while maintaining regional budget control.\\n\\n### Step 3: Campaign foundation setup\\n\\n_Campaign naming._ Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions (e.g., “FitnessApp\\\\_US\\\\_Branded\\\\_Q3”)\\n\\n_Daily budget allocation._ Set realistic daily budgets knowing Apple may exceed them on high-opportunity days. Your effective monthly budget equals daily budget × 30.4 days.\\n\\n_Campaign scheduling_. Plan launches strategically using start and end date controls, invaluable for coordinated product launches or seasonal campaigns.\\n\\n### **Step 4: Ad group architecture**\\n\\nAd groups organize related keywords under unified bidding strategies. Think of them as themed keyword buckets with shared targeting rules.\\n\\n#### **Smart ad group structures:**\\n\\n- _Branded keywords_. Your app name and variations\\n- _Competitor terms_. Rival app names and branded keywords\\n- _Category keywords_. Generic terms like “fitness app” or “meditation”\\n- _Feature-based_. Specific functionality like “calorie counter” or “workout timer”\\n- _Discovery group_. Search match-enabled for automatic keyword mining\\n\\n#### **Ad group configuration process:**\\n\\n_1\\\\. Naming strategy._ Use clear, descriptive names that indicate keyword theme and targeting (e.g., “Meditation\\\\_Competitors\\\\_iOS15+”)\\n\\n_2\\\\. Cost-Per-Tap bidding_. Set your maximum CPT bid at the ad group level. This bid automatically applies to all keywords within the group, though you can override with keyword-level bids for precise control.\\n\\nApple provides intelligent bid suggestions based on your app category, similar advertiser behavior, and competitive landscape data. These recommendations are goldmines, use them as starting points.\\n\\n_3\\\\. Cost-Per-Acquisition goals._ For search result placements, you can set CPA targets representing your maximum acceptable cost per conversion. CPA goals typically exceed CPT bids since not every tap converts.\\n\\n### Step 5: **Match type strategy**\\n\\nChoose how broadly or narrowly Apple matches your keywords to user searches:\\n\\n### Broad match\\n\\nCaptures related search variations. Bidding on “weight loss app” might show ads for searches like “diet tracker” or “fitness goals.”\\n\\n**Use for**: Discovery, reaching adjacent audiences, maximizing reach\\n\\n### Exact match\\n\\nShows ads only for precise keyword matches. Bidding on “intermittent fasting app” triggers ads solely for that exact phrase.\\n\\n**Use for**: Protecting branded terms, high-intent keywords, budget control\\n\\n### Search match:\\n\\nApple’s algorithmic keyword discovery uses your app listing, category data, and similar successful apps to automatically match relevant searches.\\n\\nSearch Match often uncovers profitable long-tail keywords you’d never think to bid on manually. Enable it in dedicated discovery ad groups to mine winning terms for manual promotion.\\n\\n### Step 6: Keyword research\\n\\nApple streamlines keyword research with intelligent recommendations based on your app and successful competitors. You can add custom keywords, and Apple suggests related terms for each addition.\\n\\nWinning keyword strategy:\\n\\n- _General terms_(like “fitness”) drive awareness but consume more budget\\n- _Specific terms_ (like “HIIT workout timer”) generate higher-quality leads with better ROI\\n- _Branded keywords_ protect your territory and capture high-intent users\\n- _Competitor keywords_ steal consideration from rivals\\n\\nContinuously edit keyword lists, pause underperformers, and promote Search Match discoveries to dedicated bidding.\\n\\n### Step 7: Product page ad placements\\n\\nFor product page placements, control which app categories display your ads:\\n\\n- _All categories_: Maximum reach but potential relevance issues\\n- _Similar categories_: Balanced approach targeting adjacent audiences\\n- _Your category only_: Highest relevance but limited scale\\n\\n### Step 8: Ad targeting settings\\n\\nLayer additional targeting based on Apple’s user data:\\n\\n- _Demographic options_: Age ranges, gender, geographic regions\\n- _Device targeting_: Specific iPhone models, iOS versions, device capabilities\\n- _Behavioral signals_: App usage patterns, purchase history, engagement levels\\n\\nNarrower targeting reduces impression volume but increases relevance. Balance reach with precision based on your goals.\\n\\n### Step 9: Scheduling ad groups\\n\\nLaunch ad groups in phases rather than all at once for controlled testing and budget management.\\n\\nRun ads only during optimal conversion windows. If weekday performance significantly outperforms weekends, schedule accordingly to maximize efficiency.\\n\\n### Step 10: Previewing, creating, and customizing ads\\n\\nThe final step lets you preview how ads appear across different placements. For certain ad placements, you can customize ad variations using different custom product pages.\\n\\nCreate keyword-specific landing experiences that match ad messaging to conversion-focused app store listings.\\n\\nOnce everything is configured, hit “Create Campaign” to launch your comprehensive Apple Ads Advanced strategy.\\n\\n## Apple Ads Basic vs. Apple Ads Advanced\\n\\n‍The choice between Apple Ads Basic and Advanced determines your entire advertising strategy and potential scale. Here’s how to make the right decision for your app’s growth stage.\\n\\n### When Apple Ads Basic makes sense\\n\\n_Perfect for:_ First-time App Store advertisers, limited marketing resources, or testing market viability.\\n\\nApple Ads Basic operates as a fully managed advertising solution. You provide Apple with a monthly budget and targeting preferences, then Apple handles everything else: keyword selection, bid optimization, creative generation, and performance management.\\n\\nApple leverages machine learning algorithms trained on millions of App Store interactions to optimize your campaigns automatically. You’re essentially renting Apple’s advertising expertise without needing in-house campaign management skills.\\n\\nBasic serves as an excellent entry point for evaluating App Store advertising potential. You can validate whether paid App Store acquisition works for your app before investing in more complex Advanced campaigns.\\n\\n### When Apple Ads Advanced becomes essential\\n\\n_Best for:_ Serious growth initiatives, multi-app portfolios, or when you need complete campaign control.\\n\\nAdvanced transforms you from a passive advertiser into an active campaign strategist. You gain granular control over budget allocation, keyword selection, audience targeting, and creative optimization across every App Store touchpoint.\\n\\nInstead of Apple making all decisions, you build sophisticated campaign structures with themed ad groups, precise keyword targeting, and custom audience segments. This control enables significantly better performance when managed expertly.\\n\\nAdvanced lets you deliver coordinated messaging across the entire user journey from awareness-building Today tab ads to conversion-focused search result placements to competitive conquest on product pages.\\n\\n### Complete feature comparison\\n\\n|  | Apple Ads Basic | Apple Ads Advanced |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Pricing model | Cost-per-install: You pay each time a user installs your app using a delivered ad | Cost-per-tap: You pay each time a user engages with your ad. You can also go with the cost-per-acquisition model for search results ads |\\n| Who it’s for | Only app makers (developers) can run Apple Ads Basic for the apps they own | Developers, advertisers, and agencies can all tap the Apple Ads Advanced platform |\\n| Number of apps the account can support | 50 | Unlimited |\\n| Monthly budget per app | USD 15,000/app/month | Unlimited |\\n| Ad placements | Apple Ads Basic lets you place your ads on top of Apple’s organic search results for your target terms | Apple Ads Advanced lets you show your ads in the App Store Today tab, on the Search tab, in App Store search results, and across other apps’ product pages that customers are browsing |\\n| Support for ad creatives | Ads are created for you | You get some control over your ad creatives |\\n| How it works | This is almost a done-for-you ad service where Apple runs your ads for you based on the monthly budget and CPI you set. A simple three-step process is all you need to get started with Apple Ads with this version | This ad service gives you granular control over every dollar you ever spend with the platform. This solution can quickly turn into a complex account for aggressive advertisers |\\n| Reporting | Offers very basic reporting focused on the number of installs and the average cost-per-install | Gives more detailed reporting than the basic version, includes stats on impressions and taps, but still leaves many questions unanswered |\\n\\n## Apple Search Ads reporting‍: The revenue attribution gap\\n\\nApple Ads is a powerful tool for driving installs. Whether you’re targeting brand keywords or exploring new markets, it can bring a steady stream of users to your app. But once those users arrive, then what?\\n\\nIf you’ve ever tried to figure out whether your Apple Ads campaigns are actually driving revenue, you’ve likely hit a wall.\\n\\nApple’s native reporting stops at the install. You get basic metrics like impressions, taps, installs, and CPI. But for most subscription-based apps, that’s not enough. What you need to know is:\\n\\n- Are these installs converting to trials?\\n- Are users sticking around and paying?\\n- Which campaigns or keywords bring the highest LTV?\\n\\nUnfortunately, Apple Ads, both Basic and Advanced, doesn’t provide answers to these questions.\\n\\n### The case for full-funnel attribution from installs to revenue\\n\\nTo make sense of Apple Ads as part of your overall growth strategy, you need full-funnel attribution. That means:\\n\\n- Knowing which campaigns, ad groups, or keywords bring in trials and subscribers\\n- Being able to compare performance across all paid channels\\n- Making decisions based on actual revenue, not install volume\\n\\nThis is the gap we designed _Adapty Ads Manager_ to fill.\\n\\n## How Adapty extends Apple Ads reporting\\n\\nAdapty connects directly to Apple’s AdServices API (no MMP required), so you get attribution from click to install to revenue, without relying on postbacks or third-party integrations.\\n\\nWhat this enables:\\n\\n- Real-time tracking of installs, trials, subscriptions, renewals, and refunds\\n- Keyword-level metrics like ROAS, ARPU, and LTV\\n- Channel and campaign comparisons in one place\\n\\nHere’s what the data can look like when tied to revenue:\\n\\n![Dashboard view of Apple Ads campaigns in Adapty Ads Manager. The table displays campaign names, statuses, ad placements, target countries (United States and Japan), daily budgets, and $0 values for spend, revenue, and ROAS across multiple branded, competitor, generic, and discovery campaigns. ](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2022/12/Adapty_ads_manager_all_campaign_groups-1024x752.webp)\\n\\nThis kind of reporting changes how you allocate budget. You’re not guessing which keywords perform best, you’re seeing it in real revenue terms.\\n\\n### Understand what happens after the install\\n\\nApple Ads tells you how many users install your app, but not what they do next.\\n\\nWith Adapty, you can go beyond install counts and see how those users behave over time. Using Funnels and [Cohorts](https://adapty.io/docs/analytics-cohorts), you can:\\n\\n- Track how many users start a trial after install\\n- See how many trials convert to subscriptions\\n- Monitor retention and revenue across time windows like 7, 30, or 90 days\\n\\n![Screenshot of Adapty’s Cohorts dashboard showing monthly cohort revenue performance filtered by Apple Ads attribution. The table displays total proceeds and average proceeds per paying user (ARPPU) across retention periods (R4 to R12), with highlighted data points for each month and attribution channel selection in the sidebar.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/63a456b1c492cb29b1efff13_szrf1bh2xfcdhlreaiicswc_z6ahgbg-gl6qoqdzdtxjn-uxb-kntustg1gbccpcgxni4djmuv0hlkq-mn-6zjfmfqc7jlxaq75sxn2c8qlyv8v4xrryqaiptkpd1jcxwgmnb6mmtag4jj1i6zsdkoepnd3shbealjx5qavttp71wxtwofjs-ctr4zvnsw.png)\\n\\nThis helps answer essential questions like:\\n\\n- Are users from Apple Ads converting better than those from Meta?\\n- Do weekly trials perform differently for Apple Ads campaigns vs organic installs?\\n- Which creatives lead to higher retention?\\n\\n![Screenshot of Adapty’s Funnels dashboard grouped by attribution channel, showing a breakdown of installs, paywall displays, and conversions to paid users across channels like Facebook Installs, Apple Ads, Organic, and Instagram.

You can also run paywall tests specifically for this segment:\\n\\n![Screenshot of Adapty’s audience segmentation UI, showing how to filter users by attribution channel.

With built-in CPT recommendations and CPI reporting, it’s a solid performance channel for subscription apps.\\n\\nBut like any paid channel, it only works as long as you keep spending. To make the most of your budget, you need to constantly optimize: bidding, creatives, keywords, and more. That takes time, expertise, or expensive agency support.\\n\\nEven then, one major blind spot remains: revenue attribution.\\n\\nKnowing which keyword brings in installs is helpful, but knowing which ones drive subscribers and revenue is critical.\\n\\nThat’s why connecting Apple Ads with your subscription analytics matters. Tools like Adapty help close this gap by showing how installs turn into trials, subscriptions, and long-term value.\\n\\nWant to go further?

Our analytics answer the growth questions that matter: which channels drive paying subscribers and sustainable revenue growth._\\n\\n## Frequently asked questions\\n\\n### What’s the difference between Apple Ads Basic and Advanced?\\n\\nApple Ads Basic is a fully automated solution ideal for early testing. You set a monthly budget (up to $10K per app), and Apple manages keyword targeting and bidding. Reporting is limited to installs and CPI. Apple Ads Advanced offers full control: keyword bidding, audience targeting, multiple ad placements (Today tab, Search tab, Product Pages), and no budget cap. It’s built for scale and granular optimization.\\n\\n### Can I track revenue from Apple Ads campaigns?\\n\\nApple Ads Basic is a fully automated solution ideal for early testing. You set a monthly budget (up to $10K per app), and Apple manages keyword targeting and bidding. Reporting is limited to installs and CPI. Apple Ads Advanced offers full control: keyword bidding, audience targeting, multiple ad placements (Today tab, Search tab, Product Pages), and no budget cap. It’s built for scale and granular optimization.\\n\\n### How do I know which keywords bring paying users?\\n\\nApple shows installs per keyword, but not whether those users convert. With tools like **Adapty**, you can track:\\n\\n– Trial starts by keyword\\n\\n– Subscription conversion\\n\\n– Keyword-level ROAS and LTV\\n\\nThis helps you avoid optimizing for low-cost installs that don’t generate revenue.\\n\\n### Is Apple Ads Basic good enough for subscription apps?\\n\\nIt’s a good starting point. Basic is useful for: – Testing paid acquisition – Running App Store ads without campaign management experience – Operating under a $10K monthly budget But for subscription apps focused on monetization, Basic lacks the visibility and control needed to scale profitably.\\n\\n### When should I switch to Apple Ads Advanced?\\n\\nSwitch to Advanced when: – You need budget flexibility beyond $10K/month – You want to control keywords, bids, placements, and targeting – You’re optimizing for trials, subscriptions, or LTV – You’re managing multiple apps or running complex campaigns\\n\\n### Does Apple Ads show ROAS or LTV?\\n\\nNo. Apple Ads does not report: – Trial starts – Subscription conversions – Revenue or retention metrics To calculate ROAS or LTV, use a tool like Adapty that connects installs to downstream subscription events.\\n\\n### Can I run Apple Ads without an MMP?\\n\\nYes. With Adapty, you can connect to Apple Ads directly via OAuth and track performance in real time, no MMP or postback setup required.\\n\\n### What placements are available in Apple Ads Advanced?\\n\\nApple Ads Advanced supports: – **Today tab** – for awareness and seasonal campaigns – **Search tab** – to capture intent before users search – **Search results** – for keyword-driven acquisition – **Product Pages** – for competitive conquest and cross-promotion Each placement supports different goals in the user journey.\\n\\n### How can I optimize Apple Ads for subscription revenue?\\n\\nTo optimize for revenue (not just installs): 1. Use Advanced to control keyword targeting and placements. 2. Track trials, conversions, and LTV via a platform like **Adapty**. 3\\\\. Test different paywalls and offers by traffic source. 4. Allocate more budget to high-ROAS keywords and campaigns.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Gohlke](https://adapty.io/author/bgohlke/)\\n\\nPublished April 30, 2025\\n\\nLast updated August 26, 2025\\n\\n9 min read\\n\\n![Cover How To Ab Test Free Trials On Ois](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/cover-how-to-ab-test-free-trials-on-ois.webp)\\n\\nAs a mobile developer, you’ve probably been asked by your marketing or app growth team to help run trial duration testing at some point. The problem for iOS apps is Apple only allows one introductory offer per subscription group. That makes it difficult to run A/B tests comparing like 3 days vs. 7 days free trials.\\n\\nThere are workarounds though that let you get the information you need to determine the best strategy for your app. We’ll take a look at some of those workarounds to help you find the sweet spot that maximizes your conversions and your LTV.\\n\\n## The one-intro-offer-per-subscription-group problem\\n\\nApple has designed its subscription infrastructure to simplify the user experience, but that means sometimes it’s at odds with the needs of developers who want to experiment. A place where these restrictions come into play is that you can only define one introductory offer per subscription group.\\n\\nA subscription group is a collection of subscriptions defined in App Store Connect that unlock the same functionality. For example, a premium subscription that has both a monthly price and a yearly price. These two subscription products, when added to the same subscription group, allow the user to purchase either one and get the same functionality. This also allows them to cross-grade their subscription to the other option without losing functionality or accidentally subscribing to both durations. A great feature for users, but this design restricts the kind of testing you can do around free trials.\\n\\nLet’s say you’ve set up a 7-day free trial for your monthly plan, but you think a 14-day trial might actually work better after collecting some initial conversion data. You can’t assign both trial lengths to products in the same subscription group. And even if you could, once a user accepts (or even sees) an intro offer, they’re locked out from redeeming any others, even if you were to change it later.\\n\\nThis limitation presents a real challenge to optimizing trial durations through testing. You can’t A/B test different lengths in a clean and native way. You risk burning your only opportunity to show your user an offer using a suboptimal trial length. And it limits your ability to iterate based on real user behavior.\\n\\nIt can be quite frustrating for teams focused on conversion optimization. Thankfully there are some ways around it. Let’s see what we can do next.\\n\\n## Creating multiple subscription groups\\n\\nA way to allow for testing of trial lengths while remaining inside the confines of Apple’s infrastructure is to create multiple subscription groups in App Store Connect, each with a different introductory trial.\\n\\nYou could create a group with a subscription product that has a 3-day trial for example. Then you’d create a second group with a similar product that instead has a 7-day trial. The obvious advantage is that you can use these two subscription options to run an A/B test to see which converts better with your audience.\\n\\nThe easiest way to do this would be to use [Adapty’s Paywall Builder](https://adapty.io/paywall-builder/) to design two paywalls that show each subscription separately but are otherwise the same. Paywall Builder allows you to quickly design a paywall and then duplicate it to build the other variant, keeping everything the same except which product is offered.\\n\\nThen you can set up an A/B test pitting those two paywalls against each other. You can make a data-driven decision about which trial length is best and even promote the winning paywall to be used for everyone after the test is complete.\\n\\n![App Store Connect interface showing how to add multiple subscription groups for testing different free trial durations in iOS apps](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-adapty-subscription-groups-1024x335.webp)\\n\\n_Create a new subscription group in App Store Connect to run A/B tests with different trial durations. Each group can have its own introductory offer configuration._\\n\\nUsing two subscription groups and Adapty’s paywall and A/B testing lets you effectively test trial durations while staying within Apple’s rules.\\n\\nIt’s not a perfect solution, however. You want to keep in mind these downsides:\\n\\n- Users can’t switch between groups. Once assigned they’re locked into that group.\\n- You need to manage the subscription groups independently in App Store Connect.\\n- Because the subscriptions exist in different groups, a user can subscribe to both concurrently. This will require some extra diligence on your part to not present both to the same user to prevent over-subscribing.\\n\\nDespite the added setup and complexity, this approach is powerful because it preserves the “Free Trial” label in the App Store purchase screen, which users are trained to look for and is a key factor in conversion rates.\\n\\n## Running country-based free trial testing\\n\\nAnother option is to leverage the fact that Apple allows you to assign introductory offers on a per-country basis to test what might convert better.\\n\\nThe advantages to this approach are that you don’t have to create or manage multiple subscription groups, and that it’s pretty simple to configure in App Store Connect.\\n\\nThe downside is you will need to compare trial start and conversion data between the regions you’ve set up and differences in behavior could skew the results.\\n\\nThis is not a pure A/B test so it will be hard to isolate the trial length as the only variable. For example, you may need to adjust the copy and design on your paywalls a bit to fit local cultural norms for each region.\\n\\n![Apple’s App Store Connect interface showing how to assign a free trial to specific countries. It's a workaround for testing multiple free trial offers by region.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-intro-offer-country-selection-947x1024.webp)_Create an introductory offer, but choose a small subset of countries to isolate the test of the free trial. You can create multiple introductory offers on the same subscription with different countries for each._\\n\\nTo set this up, you could do something like the following:\\n\\n- A 3-day trial for users in the U.S.\\n- A 7-day trial for users in Canada.\\n- No trial at all in another region if you want a control group.\\n\\nThen you could compare behavior across those regions in a tool like [Adapty’s analytics dashboard](https://adapty.io/revenue-analytics/) to see which trial lengths drive better conversion, retention, and long-term revenue.\\n\\nThis approach works especially well when you’re early in the experimentation phase and want to determine what’s directionally correct for your conversion strategy. If you see clear differences between regions, it’s a clue to look deeper at how you’ve presented each and refine the test.\\n\\n## Setting up custom trials **outside Apple’s intro offers**\\n\\nIf you want to be free of the limitations that Apple sets, you do have the option of “rolling your own” free trial logic that’s outside of Apple’s introductory offer system. This affords you the flexibility you might want, but it’s also the most technically intense workaround.\\n\\nInstead of relying on the App Store to manage the trial, you would opt users into a free trial with [a custom button](https://adapty.io/docs/paywall-buttons) from an Adapty paywall that actually triggers a call to the Adapty servers to [grant access to premium features](https://adapty.io/docs/ss-grant-access-level) for a set amount of time. This effectively sets up a “free trial” of the premium features, but bypasses actually making a purchase or automatically opting the user into converting to paid at the end of the trial. You would have to show them a traditional paywall at the end of the trial with subscription products for them to choose from.\\n\\n![Adapty Paywall Builder interface showing a custom button setup for activating a free trial using app-side logic.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-custom-free-trial-button-1024x571.webp)_Using Adapty’s Paywall Builder, create a button that has a custom action. This action can then be used by the app to trigger an access level change for the user to enable the custom-logic free trial._\\n\\nThis approach lets you test any trial duration you want since you’re controlling access to premium features directly for an arbitrary amount of time. You also don’t have to worry about the overhead of multiple subscription groups and you can run real A/B tests with Adapty’s tools to make a data-driven decision about what converts better.\\n\\nThis may sound like the perfect solution, but there are a few things to consider first. There won’t be a free trial label anywhere on the App Store checkout screen or the store listing. Users are trained to look for this and it may be a bit of a deterrent. It’s also more technical work and overhead on your part to manage these internal free trials. And since this management logic is on you rather than Apple, you’ll have to code it carefully to reasonably guard against abuse.\\n\\nIt is a fair amount of initial work to get going, but paired with the Adapty in-app purchase SDK and the A/B testing and analytics features in the Adapty dashboard, you’ll end up with a setup that gives you unmatched flexibility for experimentation with free trials.\\n\\n## What does the data really tell you?\\n\\nOnce you’ve run your experiments long enough to generate statistically significant data (made much shorter by using Adapty’s [AI-powered A/B test winner prediction](https://adapty.io/docs/predictions-in-ab-tests)), it’s time to use this data to figure out what’s working.\\n\\nStart by evaluating the trial groups against key metrics like: which trial length led to the highest trial-to-paid conversion; whether shorter trial lengths created urgency, or maybe just higher churn; and which trial length led to users with higher LTV or longer retention.\\n\\nYou can use the above data with Adapty’s [cohort analysis](https://adapty.io/docs/analytics-cohorts) feature to also see how long these people stuck around and how much revenue they generated over time.\\n\\nAs you analyze your results, here are some things to keep in mind to prevent the data from leading you down the wrong path:\\n\\n- Don’t rely solely on short-term conversion rates. Sometimes longer free trials convert fewer people, but those users produce a [higher LTV](https://adapty.io/docs/ltv).\\n- If you have high conversion but high churn, take a look at: revenue per user in addition to conversion rate, churn in the first 1-2 billing cycles, and engagement of those users during the trial to make sure they are actually experiencing the value you’re providing.\\n- Sample size can really skew your conclusions when comparing variants, so make sure your sample sizes are large enough. If not, consider extending the length of your test or re-run it with larger cohorts.\\n\\nLastly, the best-performing trial might surprise you so be sure to try options that don’t necessarily seem to be obvious winners. Testing and iteration are critical for success in this process.\\n\\nAt Adapty, we help app teams with tools built specifically for subscription businesses.

Sometimes the process can be delayed if the developer violates one or a few of them. The violations can be rude, like the app containing prohibited content, or rather small, like a mistake in the description of an in-app purchase.\\n\\nTogether with Dmitry Kuznetsov, head of a mobile software development department for multimedia playback and processing, we’ll try to figure out what may help you quickly and easily pass the review of a subscription-based app.\\n\\n## What you need to know about the App Store reviews\\n\\nAn application gets reviewed every time a new version is published, even if the changes are minimal. The developer can swap a couple of buttons without touching the main features of the app at all, but it still has to be rebuilt and submitted for review.\\n\\nThe App Store is very thorough with their reviewing process, as they’re responsible for the quality of apps. The users cannot be exposed to poorly performing, dangerous, or misleading content. Apps for children are subject to particularly close scrutiny, as they shouldn’t contain any prohibited content or hidden features.\\n\\nThe store can review an already published app on its own initiative or based on the users’ complaints. Such extraordinary reviews are quite rare but they allow Apple to identify apps made by unscrupulous developers that contain hidden features.\\n\\nAlso, experts can pay attention to the application, whose users often request a refund for purchases. If there are too many such applications, this is a sign that something is wrong with the application.\\n\\nApple removes old apps from the store that aren’t updated or reviewed for a year. The developer of such an application first receives a reminder to release a new version within 90 days. If they don’t, the app is removed.\\n\\n### App Store Review checklist\\n\\n| Category | Check |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **App stability** | ✅ No crashes or blocking bugs |\\n| **Metadata** | ✅ Title, description, keywords updated |\\n| **Screenshots & preview** | ✅ Match current app version |\\n| **In-app purchases** | ✅ Correct setup and descriptions |\\n| **Login methods** | ✅ Sign in with Apple added if required |\\n| **Privacy** | ✅ Privacy policy linked |\\n| **Test account** | ✅ Provided to Apple |\\n| **Compliance** | ✅ Regional laws covered |\\n\\n[![demo page 5 3](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/demo-page-5-3-1024x286.png)](https://adapty.io/schedule-demo/)\\n\\n## Which verifications an iOS app goes through\\n\\nIn order for the app to get reviewed, you need to upload its build, that is, a ready-made application file, to App Store Connect. There it goes through processing – automatic review on basic parameters and scanning for malicious code. For example, the application must not read and transfer the program code to the user’s device – it’s prohibited by the store rules. An exception is made only for educational purposes: if the user learns to develop in the app, then a code editor can be used inside it.\\n\\nThe processing reveals even small technical inconsistencies with the rules. For example, an app might fail the verification because it was built using an outdated version of Xcode. In this case, the developer will receive a message saying that the application needs to be rebuilt and resubmitted for review. If the processing reveals several violations, they will all be listed. The whole process usually takes an average of 20 minutes, but sometimes it can last longer – up to several hours.\\n\\nWhen the processing is finished, you need to confirm sending the app for review and wait for it to start. Starting 2022, App Store Connect has a new verification process: the developer can submit for review in-app events, in-app product pages and tests without creating a new version of the app. Those items that have failed the review can be temporarily hidden, and those that got through successfully can be published.\\n\\nApple doesn’t disclose what exactly happens during the review, but 100% of the time the app is reviewed by the employees of the review team. They don’t test the whole app, but check the main use case scenarios, several screens, and see how in-app purchases work.\\n\\nThe review waiting time depends on the availability of the review team. Before big holidays and long weekends, such as Christmas and New Year, there are fewer employees, so the waiting gets longer and the process itself gets more time consuming.\\n\\nOn average, waiting for a review in the App Store takes about 9 hours, and the review itself takes about a day, according to the [Runway data](https://www.runway.team/appreviewtimes).\\n\\n## Specifics of the first App Store review\\n\\nReviewing the very first version of an app can take longer, up to 1 month, especially if it has non-standard user flow or unusual features. During the first review, the store employee may have questions about the operation of the app. In this case, the process will be paused and the developer will receive an email containing certain questions.\\n\\nIf the app requires signing in, the review team employee will ask you to send a login and password to access the test account. To avoid this, it’s better to specify the necessary info in the build description beforehand. The store employee may also want to clarify the target audience of the app or for what purpose it will be used for.\\n\\nSometimes the review team asks for more information on how the app works. In this case, you can describe the functionality in text or record a screencast for better understanding.\\n\\n![6322e188d1185619d148bcd8 sorf6p 58aquibqkeynwm91wqralj5llyeiokp ruthcetumr30fgqrpud2za64rh0krygn7 tc1ti6xdlkfabdgtzqniyryustwnhpqkkufq6npx2afm](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6322e188d1185619d148bcd8_sorf6p-58aquibqkeynwm91wqralj5llyeiokp-ruthcetumr30fgqrpud2za64rh0krygn7_tc1ti6xdlkfabdgtzqniyryustwnhpqkkufq6npx2afm-e9jgozsrlhjffd0274ifcpobmpfogpy3tyggj_ear6qfzm66qh4ujn74dplbchy4n9xg.png)_A request from the review team: you need to explain exactly how the app works_\\n\\nAnother frequent request is how and why user data is processed. For example, when an app requests access to contacts or geolocation, but doesn’t explicitly use them.\\n\\nDuring the review, you need to confirm that the app doesn’t violate anyone’s copyrights. The developer must provide documents that allow them to use music, videos, trademarks or any other intellectual property. The right to publish the app will also have to be confirmed if it’s not developed by the company that owns the brand.\\n\\n![6322e188859b9605a9526e66 er3 s0ax7ocikr 8dcdglji9645g8f2kmmc13qwyxwcve60iurdvtlhvojvbifngfynbf6gsix7fy9ydkdelfbb0kj8azqy5gj3eydej9l bkcz tgxzmreyabfzsz3xnwruvqkde7ypuz tpxzckq0ask12zz0f8waco11rrydh1g6sd vvqtvnqq](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6322e188859b9605a9526e66_er3-s0ax7ocikr-8dcdglji9645g8f2kmmc13qwyxwcve60iurdvtlhvojvbifngfynbf6gsix7fy9ydkdelfbb0kj8azqy5gj3eydej9l-bkcz_tgxzmreyabfzsz3xnwruvqkde7ypuz_tpxzckq0ask12zz0f8waco11rrydh1g6sd-vvqtvnqq.png)_A request for documents confirming the publisher rights_\\n\\nYou’ll also need to provide the documents on the data encryption algorithm if your app uses non-standard for iOS encryption methods.\\n\\nReviews of subsequent versions of the app, especially those with small updates, usually take much less time. If you tweak only in-app purchases, you don’t have to send the whole app for review. In App Store Connect, an app developer can now initiate a review process for a new subscription option, product page, or specific pages. It means that you won’t need to create a completely new version of the app – only specify the elements that need to be reviewed.\\n\\n## Why an app can fail the iOS review\\n\\nFirst and foremost, an app fails the review if it violates the App Store policies. If the expert finds a violation during the review, they reject the app and indicate the reason. In this case, they refer to at least one of the store rules, but don’t always specify what exactly needs to be changed. So the developer has to guess which element of the app seemed violating to the reviewer.\\n\\nThe human factor can also be an influence during the review, which can be both good and bad for the developer. In some cases, the expert may miss a violation, for example, if it doesn’t appear in every use case scenario. On the other hand, they may reject an app for a formal reason in an ambiguous situation.\\n\\nIf the developer is sure that no requirements are violated, they can appeal the expert’s decision. To do this, they need to provide evidence that the app complies with all the rules. Sometimes it helps to build a new version with minimal changes, as there’s a chance it will get tested by another, less biased specialist and successfully pass the review.\\n\\nSome developers deliberately violate the rules and insert hidden features in the app that can be enabled remotely or run by timer after the app is reviewed and published in the store. Such apps are sooner or later found and removed, with their developers receiving sanctions up to account blocking.\\n\\nMore reasons for rejection:\\n\\n- Bugs, too long content loading time or unstable work\\n- Not all functions are properly implemented, e.g., unresponsive buttons\\n- Privacy violation – the app trying to access the user’s data for no reason\\n\\n| Rejection reason | App Store guideline | Why it happens | How to fix |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Crashes on launch | 2.1 App Completeness | App not fully tested | Test on real devices |\\n| Incomplete metadata | 2.3 Accurate Metadata | Missing or misleading info | Update App Store Connect |\\n| Broken links | 2.3.3 | Invalid URLs in app or metadata | Check all external links |\\n| Hidden paywalls | 3.1 Payments | No clear disclosure | Explain pricing upfront |\\n| Missing Sign in with Apple | 4.8 | Third-party login used | Add Apple login |\\n| Guideline violations | Multiple | Policy misunderstanding | Review Apple guidelines |\\n\\n## How to make sure your app passes the review\\n\\nThe first thing you need to pay attention to before submitting your app for review is [the App Store guideline](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/), which describes all the publishing rules. They are updated from time to time, so it is important to follow the news for developers. For example, the most recent update to the posting rules concerns the ability to delete the user account and all the data associated with it. If there’s no such feature in the app, it won’t be able to pass the review.\\n\\nFor a subscription-based app, special attention should be paid to the requirements for the design and content of the in-app purchases. The store makes sure that the users’ receive exactly what they expected after the purchase: unlocking new features, getting access to new content, or activating a subscription.\\n\\nWhat you need to successfully pass the review:\\n\\n- Show all subscriptions or product options on one screen\\n- Describe each product clearly and fully so that the user understands what they purchase and at what price\\n- Even if the purchase terms take up a lot of space on the screen, they must be written in a readable font\\n- The terms must be visible at least partially without scrolling the screen\\n- Correctly indicate the cost and currencies of the purchase for the countries the app is available in\\n- Highlight the main, most beneficial subscription or purchase option\\n- Check that the description matches the content of the in-app purchase\\n- Correctly translate the product descriptions into all the languages ​​used in the app\\n\\n![6323fd279489a2a2c5563d1c 2221](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6323fd279489a2a2c5563d1c_2221.png)![6323ff92a18e6bb2c258820d wall2s](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6323ff92a18e6bb2c258820d_wall2s.png)\\n\\nAdditionally, it’s worth checking that the app has a “Restore Purchases” button, links to the privacy policy and terms of use. You should also remember to insert all the products and subscription options available on the purchase screen into the app itself.\\n\\n### Subscription and paywall requirements\\n\\n| Requirement | Apple expectation |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Pricing clarity | Price and billing period shown |\\n| Auto-renew disclosure | Clearly stated |\\n| Free trial | Conditions explained |\\n| Restore purchases | Visible option |\\n| Terms & Privacy | Accessible from paywall |\\n| Cancellation info | Explained clearly |\\n\\n## How to avoid unnecessary reviews\\n\\nWith every new version of the app, which may only bring a few minor changes to the build, you need to send your app for review. But there’s one way to completely avoid unnecessary reviews, and you may resort to it when editing your paywall.\\n\\nSolutions like [Adapty](https://adapty.io/) offer to build paywalls around the remote config feature, that enables developers to make changes to every paywall element remotely within seconds and no need to create a new version of the app. You simply need to attach placeholder values to every element of your paywall beforehand and then simply substitute their content with the help of a convenient JSON editor.\\n\\n![bded30e remote config](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bded30e-remote_config-1024x648.png)_Adapty’s remote config view_\\n\\nAnother way is to create your paywall from scratch with the help of Adapty’s [Paywall Builder](https://adapty.io/paywall-builder/). Using this tool, you’ll be able to choose among numerous templates and then adjust every element in a more user-friendly visual paywall editor with no code or designer help required. Create a paywall in 5 minutes and then either make it live in the app or create one more and start an A/B test to see which one performs better. Anyway, if you decide to make any changes to the live paywall made with the builder it will be a piece of cake that will also work based on the principle of remote config but in a more convenient manner.\\n\\n![Builder](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Builder.webp)_Adapty’s Paywall Builder interface_\\n\\nSo if you plan on running paywall A/B tests or simply like the idea of applying changes to your app’s paywall without the need to send it for another long review – make sure to check [what Adapty is about in our docs](https://adapty.io/docs/).\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### How long does App Store review usually take?\\n\\nIn most cases, App Store review takes 24–72 hours. App updates are often reviewed faster than new apps. Review time can vary depending on app complexity, guideline compliance, and current App Store review workload.\\n\\n### Is App Store review fully automated or manual?\\n\\nApp Store review is not fully automated. Apple uses a combination of automated checks and human reviewers who manually test the app, review metadata, verify compliance with guidelines, and evaluate user experience and monetization transparency.\\n\\n### What are the most common App Store rejection reasons?\\n\\nThe most common reasons include app crashes or bugs, incomplete or misleading metadata, unclear subscription pricing, missing privacy disclosures, broken links, and violations of App Store Review Guidelines such as payment or login requirements.\\n\\n### What should I check before submitting an app to the App Store?\\n\\nBefore submitting, make sure the app is stable, all features work as described, metadata and screenshots are accurate, subscriptions and paywalls are clearly explained, privacy policy links are included, and a test account is provided if login is required.\\n\\n### Can I appeal an App Store rejection?\\n\\nRe-review after rejection usually takes 24–72 hours, similar to the initial review. Minor fixes may be reviewed faster, while more complex changes can take longer depending on Apple’s review queue.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

They breeze through onboarding, love their first session, and then… churn. Like, ghosted-you-after-one-date gone. That’s Death Valley, the spot where subscription apps crash, burn and churn users.\\n\\nI talked to 50+ app product leaders in early 2025. Four out of five confirmed: **“2 sessions completed within the first week” is their critical activation metric**. Hit that, and users retain longer, trials convert better, and subscription apps make more realized LTV.\\n\\nYet most apps see 77% of their users churning by day 3.\\n\\nDay 3!\\n\\nAll that ad money, all that effort that went into creative strategy, organic and ASO to acquire users, iterating onboarding to increase trial starts or conversions: gone for most users you acquired.\\n\\nYou might think: _“But I can hit $3M ARR just by focusing on user acquisition, onboarding and the first session!”_\\n\\nSure, maybe.\\n\\nBut that plan is going to hit a wall, be sure about that. CAC goes through the roof because your user acquisition machine will get less effective over time.\\n\\nThe bridge from the first to second session doesn’t start after users leave your app. It starts within that crucial first session.\\n\\nBrilliant (Duolingo for computer science & math) mastered the bridge. Here are **five easy tricks from them to reduce churn and keep your users coming back**.\\n\\n## Make the first session quick, valuable, and fun to stay ahead of churn\\n\\nGetting more users back into the second session starts with the first session.\\n\\nFirst sessions aren’t what they used to be. Way back, you could make people spend 10-15 minutes in the first session and still see high completion rates.\\n\\nNeedless to say that those good days are over in the fast-dopamine-hunting world we live in (thanks, TikTok).\\n\\n**The magic is balancing this triangle:**\\n\\n- **Short** enough to feel quickly to accomplish (Brilliant’s took me 2min 14sec; done before my coffee is cold)\\n- **Valuable** enough to provide real learning (proof users get what they signed up for, for Brilliant → become a problem solver)\\n- **Fun** enough to enjoy the process (never forget: as a health/education app, your app feels like work to users; so make that work fun; Brilliant is a math app but doesn’t feel like homework)\\n\\n![Churn kicks in fast. Brilliant counters it with a 2-minute first session that’s smooth and satisfying.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-1024x1024.webp)_Brilliant’s first session is just 2 minutes long_\\n\\nIt might take a couple iterations to get it to work. But it’s definitely worth it.\\n\\n**Metrics to watch:**\\n\\n- 1st lesson start rate (if it’s below 60%, simplify your first home landing)\\n- 1st lesson completion rate (aim for >60%)\\n\\n## Obsessively celebrate them\\n\\nThis is the most crucial part. So let’s pay extra attention to it.\\n\\nWe’ve all read _Hooked_ by Nir Eyal, and know about the habit loop. If you don’t, here’s a recap of the framework that you should never forget if you’re serious about building sticky apps. The framework describes how habits are formed and maintained.\\n\\n**It includes:**\\n\\n- **Trigger**: starts the habit, can be external (push, notification) or internal (boredom, anxiety). Example: a push by Duolingo’s Duo makes you anxious to lose your streak\\n- **Action**: behavior you perform in response to the trigger (open Duolingo)\\n- **Variable Reward**: keeps users hooked (=wanting more). Streaks, animation, haptic feedback, makes your brain swim in dopamine and crave more. Better if not predictable, that’s why Duolingo adds so much variety to their celebrations.\\n- **Investment**: make users invest time, effort or data to increase the odds of the next trigger (complete the next lesson).\\n\\nWhat we want is to make users feel accomplished, and make them want to feel this more often. Good dopamine, reward state of the habit loop.\\n\\n![Churn shows up by day 3, Brilliant’s quick, rewarding session helps stop it before it starts.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Brilliant-session.gif)\\n\\nBrilliant throws a party every time you finish. **It’s a 3-part celebration:**\\n\\n- **Nice work**: we all love a good tap on the shoulder, and a buzz in your hand with haptic feedback\\n- **Recap learning**: makes progress visible; reminds you what you’ve just learned\\n- **Streak counter**: shows you the streak count, nudges you to the next mini-milestone (day 3, to boost activation), and taps into identity (become a problem-solver)\\n\\nSuch a strong flow, Brilliant’s product growth team kills it here.\\n\\nBecause identity-based goals (become a problem solver) trigger behavior change stronger than outcome-based goals (reach 3-day streak).\\n\\nIt’s a 20-second experience for Brilliant. You don’t have to go as sophisticated as they went. Free Lottie files (lottiefiles.com) does the job already. Use Rive (rive.app) if you want to step up.\\n\\n![Churn kicks in fast. Brilliant slows it down by turning your first win into a mini holiday.](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-1-1024x1024.webp)_Brilliant celebrates first win like it’s your aunt’s birthday_\\n\\n_“Is consciously triggering a user’s dopamine evil?”,_ you might ask yourself.\\n\\nIt’s not. Your users want to spend more time in your health/education app instead of wasting hours on TikTok. It’s your duty to help them stay on track to something that’s worthwhile for them. If you’re in gaming, social networks, or entertainment, this doesn’t apply to you (you’re most likely already aware of these dynamics).\\n\\n## Remind them why they’re here\\n\\nAt this point, your users are pumped and feel hyped. They’ve just learned something new (education app), feel calmer (meditation/prayer app), or feel exhausted but in a good way (fitness app).\\n\\nIt’s a state we love.\\n\\nThink back to the last time you were in that state. Completed a 5k run, and a good feeling rushes to your body. Imagine your running buddy now asks you: “Want to run in two days again?”.\\n\\nYou’re likely to say yes. In fact, you’ll probably never be more likely to say yes.\\n\\nLet’s use the high user psych to help them feel this again, and start building a habit.\\n\\n![The app won't let you go until you commit to a goal](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-1024x1024.webp)_The app won’t let you go until you commit to a goal_\\n\\nBrilliant strengthens the habit loop (investment) by **making users commit to a streak-goal**. Users have to do that, there’s no way to skip this screen. Smart.\\n\\nThey tap into the goal gradient effect here: we’re more motivated to complete a task as we get closer to a goal. The 3-, 7-, and 14-day goals are broken up into incremental milestones (“Great”, “Amazing”, “Phenomenal”).\\n\\nOnce users select a goal, they have to commit to it (CTA). When we commit to something, we feel a psychological need to follow through. It’s self-imposed accountability, and can be a powerful nudge to make users want to come back.\\n\\n## Capture commitment\\n\\nBuilding habits is tough.\\n\\nYour job is to make establishing a habit around your core app activity easy-peasy.\\n\\nAs we’re in the high user psych state, this is the perfect time to help users feel the good dopamine from your app again.\\n\\nThat’s why Brilliant prompts the notification permission on the next screen.\\n\\n![Don’t forget to enable their notifications! Otherwise, how will you bring them back?](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-1-1024x1024.webp)_Don’t forget to enable their notifications! Otherwise, how will you bring them back?_\\n\\n“Well done! Want to do this more often? “Let us help you.”\\n\\nAgain, well played, Brilliant PMs!\\n\\nI’m sure they see high notification adoption rates here because people are buzzing.\\n\\nThere’s also a new way to nudge users back into your app: lock distracting apps like TikTok and Instagram until your users activate the second session in your app. “Complete your next Spanish lesson in Duolingo to unlock TikTok.”\\n\\nEssentially, this is your native screen time feature for retention. When users open social media during a specific time (e.g. morning), they see a full-screen nudge that reminds them to do a session in your app. It’s like your app telling users, “Hey, finish your lesson in my app first”. You can build it yourself or launch it with [Wellspent’s SDK](https://wellspent.so/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=guest-post&utm_campaign=adapty&utm_term=activation) in a couple days. Full discloser: my team built the SDK.\\n\\n## Preview the second session\\n\\nI’m repeating myself. But because this is so essential to building habit-forming products, I want to make sure it sticks:\\n\\nIt’s your job to make it as easy as possible to activate the second session. Your responsibility.\\n\\nIf you only take away one thing, I hope it’s this.\\n\\nBrilliant shows what the exact next lesson is about and allows users to start it with one tap.\\n\\n![Brilliant lets users activate the second session in one tap](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-1024x1024.webp)_Show them what’s next and make it easy to get there_\\n\\n**What happens from a psychological point:**\\n\\n- **Zeigarnik Effect**: We are more likely to remember and feel compelled to complete unfinished things. By showing the user what’s coming next, Brilliant creates an open loop: they’ve started their learning journey, and the app very subtly reminds them that there’s more to explore. This creates a psychological itch to return and close the loop by starting the next session.\\n- **1-Tap-Access**: You probably can’t hear it anymore but I’ll double down: reduce friction. Friction kills your growth. Lower the activation energy to start the next loop by making it dead-simple to activate the second session. Brilliant does it well: one CTA, name of the lesson highlighted. As a user, I know exactly what to do. No brainer.\\n\\nWhat you want to prevent is decision-fatigue: “What am I supposed to do now?”. It’s the number one killer for habit formation.\\n\\nThe next step is crystal clear. Perfect starting point for the next habit loop.\\n\\n**You’re on the right track when you get >50% of the first session completions into the second session.**\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDuolingo’s CPO Cem Kansu says you’re in the habit-building business, with three products: onboarding, core activity, and retention mechanics.\\n\\nThere’s a ton of validated retention mechanics out there, so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. These five tips are relatively low effort, potentially high impact things you can launch within days or weeks. I genuinely hope this is useful for you to drive activation.\\n\\nMost apps die in death valley. Your app doesn’t have to.\\n\\nTo dive deeper into how your retention strategy impacts churn and subscription growth, check out this guide on [**cohort analysis for subscription apps**](https://adapty.io/blog/cohort-analysis-mobile-subscriptions/).\\n\\nBig props to Brilliant for lighting the way.\\n\\n## Key takeaways\\n\\n1. **Make the first session short, valuable and fun:** short enough to feel quickly to accomplish, valuable enough to provide real progress, fun enough to enjoy the process.\\n2. **Obsessively celebrate them**: Most crucial part: dopamine high lifts user psych. Make them want to feel this more often. Go all in on animations, haptic feedback.\\n3. **Remind them why they’re here**: Leverage high user psych to commit them to the next milestone. Identity-based goals (become a problem solver) > outcome-based goals (complete three lessons).\\n4. **Capture commitment**: Leverage high user psych to get them into push notifications or your screen time feature to remind them of the core activity within your app.\\n5. **Preview the second session**: Show the exact next lesson with one-tap access. make it crystal clear what comes next to prevent decision fatigue.\\n\\n## About the author\\n\\nSelcuk Aciner is the co-founder of Wellspent.

The `starter` branch contains the app without Adapty integration and a mocked purchase experience, while the `main` branch contains the finished project.\\n\\n## Install the Adapty SDK in your project\\n\\nAdd the following to the versions section of the `libs.versions.toml` file:\\n\\n```\\n[versions]\\nadaptyBom = \\\"3.10.0\\\"\\n```\\n\\n```\\n[versions]\\nadaptyBom = \\\"3.10.0\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThen, in the same file, add the following definitions to the Libraries section:\\n\\n```\\n[libraries]\\nadapty-android-sdk = { module = \\\"io.adapty:android-sdk\\\" }\\nadapty-bom = { module = \\\"io.adapty:adapty-bom\\\", version.ref = \\\"adaptyBom\\\" }\\n```\\n\\n```\\n[libraries]\\nadapty-android-sdk = { module = \\\"io.adapty:android-sdk\\\" }\\nadapty-bom = { module = \\\"io.adapty:adapty-bom\\\", version.ref = \\\"adaptyBom\\\" }\\n```\\n\\nAnd finally, add the Adapty Android SDK to your app-level `build.gradle.kts` file:\\n\\n```\\ndependencies {\\n    // ...Other dependencies\\n\\n    // Adapty SDK\\n    implementation(platform(libs.adapty.bom))\\n    implementation(libs.adapty.android.sdk)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\ndependencies {\\n    // ...Other dependencies\\n\\n    // Adapty SDK\\n    implementation(platform(libs.adapty.bom))\\n    implementation(libs.adapty.android.sdk)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSync your project to install the dependencies.\\n\\n## Initialize Adapty in your app\\n\\nFirst, add these constants to your `utils/AppConstants.kt` file:\\n\\n```\\npackage io.adapty.FocusJournal.utils\\n\\nobject AppConstants {\\n    object Adapty {\\n        const val API_KEY = \\\"API key goes here\\\"\\n        const val ACCESS_LEVEL_ID = \\\"premium\\\"\\n        const val PLACEMENT_ID = \\\"on_tap_history\\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\npackage io.adapty.FocusJournal.utils\\n\\nobject AppConstants {\\n    object Adapty {\\n        const val API_KEY = \\\"API key goes here\\\"\\n        const val ACCESS_LEVEL_ID = \\\"premium\\\"\\n        const val PLACEMENT_ID = \\\"on_tap_history\\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n🔐 Find your public SDK key: [Adapty Dashboard > Settings > API Keys](https://app.adapty.io/settings)\\n\\nNext, initialize Adapty in your `FocusJournalApplication.kt` file:\\n\\n```\\npackage io.adapty.FocusJournal\\n\\n// ...Existing imports\\nimport com.adapty.Adapty\\nimport com.adapty.models.AdaptyConfig.Builder\\nimport io.adapty.focusjournal.utils.AppConstants\\n\\nclass FocusJournalApplication : Application() {\\n\\n    // ...\\n\\n    override fun onCreate() {\\n        super.onCreate()\\n\\n        // Initialize Adapty SDK\\n        Adapty.activate(this, Builder(AppConstants.Adapty.API_KEY).build())\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```\\npackage io.adapty.FocusJournal\\n\\n// ...Existing imports\\nimport com.adapty.Adapty\\nimport com.adapty.models.AdaptyConfig.Builder\\nimport io.adapty.focusjournal.utils.AppConstants\\n\\nclass FocusJournalApplication : Application() {\\n\\n    // ...\\n\\n    override fun onCreate() {\\n        super.onCreate()\\n\\n        // Initialize Adapty SDK\\n        Adapty.activate(this, Builder(AppConstants.Adapty.API_KEY).build())\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis call configures and activates the Adapty SDK when your app launches.\\n\\n## Set up profile handling\\n\\nNext, edit the `ProfileManager.kt` file to add Adapty integration.\\n\\nThe primary changes are the addition of the Adapty profile property, the call to refresh the profile, and updating premium status based on the profile’s access levels.\\n\\n```\\npackage io.adapty.FocusJournal.viewmodel\\n\\n// Add these import statements\\nimport com.adapty.Adapty\\nimport com.adapty.models.AdaptyProfile\\nimport com.adapty.utils.AdaptyResult\\nimport

MutableStateFlow(false)\\n    val isLoading: StateFlow<Boolean> = _isLoading.asStateFlow()\\n\\n    // Update the existing isPremium declaration to pull data from the profile\\n    val isPremium:

your `PaywallScreen.kt` file to integrate with Adapty’s purchase flow. This will replace the mocked purchase experience from the starter branch for a proper paywall with elements loaded from Adapty’s SDK:\\n\\nNote: In the starter branch, you’ll find an `updateDialog` composable view function. Simply delete the entire function and replace it with the `PaywallScreen`, `FeatureItem`, and `ProductButton` composable view functions.\\n\\n```\\npackage io.adapty.focusjournal.ui.screen\\n\\nimport

of mobile app paywalls and conversion hacks they use\\n\\nLast updated December 18,

Sharma](https://adapty.io/author/disha-sharma/)\\n\\nPublished September 30, 2022\\n\\nLast updated December 18, 2025\\n\\n15 min read\\n\\n![6336ba7cd7f0d738c831dee8 September Update](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/6336ba7cd7f0d738c831dee8_september-update-scaled.png)\\n\\nOptimizing your mobile app paywall for more conversions begins with choosing the right type of paywall. Why? Because mobile app paywalls come in many forms.\\n\\nFor example, if an app’s top user acquisition channel is offering free trials, it’s best if the app uses a trial-focused paywall – one that clearly explains how the trial works and the value the user can get out of it. Likewise, a premium app might be better off using a longform paywall over the standard version if it takes a lot of convincing to sell. And if an app is looking to quickly get a few upgrades, adding an “offer” paywall is a good hack.\\n\\nSaid another way: You need to be intentional when planning your paywalls. And to help you do that, today we’re rounding up ten of the most popular mobile app paywall types. In addition to discussing the different paywall types, we’ll also see the various conversion principles they use.\\n\\n## The 10 most popular mobile app paywall types with examples\\n\\n1\\\\. Standard non-scrollable\\n\\n2\\\\. “Landing page”\\n\\n3\\\\. Modal\\n\\n4\\\\. Trial\\n\\n5\\\\. Trial toggle\\n\\n6\\\\. Single plan\\n\\n7\\\\. Multiplan\\n\\n8\\\\. Offer\\n\\n9\\\\. Donation\\n\\n10\\\\. Personalized\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Standard non-scrollable paywall\\n\\nThis is the most common mobile app paywall you get to see. Here, the mobile viewport is all the space you have. This is also why this paywall type works – everything your users need to see is available immediately. The information displayed on this paywall often includes:\\n\\n- The main headline (explaining why a user should purchase your app)\\n- The app’s key features and benefits\\n- Elements of social proof\\n- Plans\\n- Offers (if applicable)\\n- A call to action button\\n- Links to relevant content (like your privacy policy, terms, and FAQs)\\n\\n[Moonly’s paywall](https://adapty.io/case-studies/moonly-app) is a great example: it comes with a good headline (that clearly states the benefits of purchasing), a beautiful grid highlighting all the premium features, plans, a CTA button, and links to the necessary resources:\\n\\n![6336bbad47356d85a7088ed3 hsehngyhjfe9rviugvcxetqva1alrbi9hqo8pyxpdw7ijg4xrvobbckznhvafrcfh4bcbuk9qsmrt hsuw himbxctur kungvttl8h skoiyler0mqfmygzwd7nojt45qnaqn6pxsen8jybof](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336bbad47356d85a7088ed3_hsehngyhjfe9rviugvcxetqva1alrbi9hqo8pyxpdw7ijg4xrvobbckznhvafrcfh4bcbuk9qsmrt_hsuw_himbxctur_kungvttl8h-skoiyler0mqfmygzwd7nojt45qnaqn6pxsen8jybof-xrqqefi2hv09wvgmje0uiwiofo9tncnhrab8pkq.png)\\n\\nHowever, because of space constraints, this paywall type can only accommodate so much. In this case, Moonly ditches elements of social proof. And why is it a problem? This is a problem because app ratings and reviews are excellent social proof that convinces people to pay for your app. _Did you know that_ [_80% of mobile app users read at least one review_](https://www.businessofapps.com/insights/ratings-reviews-affect-consumer-decision-download-apps/) _before downloading a paid app?_ Since users rely heavily on reviews, posting social proof on your paywall can drastically improve your conversion rate.\\n\\nSome [publishers](https://adapty.io/for-publishers/) work around this limitation by adding carousels and videos to the paywall. These elements help offer much more information, even in this paywall type’s compact space.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. “Landing page” paywall\\n\\nThis is a deviation from the standard non-scrollable mobile app paywall. Here, you don’t cram everything into a single screen but go with a “longform” format. You treat your app paywall like a mobile landing page.\\n\\nNapper is an excellent example:\\n\\n![ezgif 1 d25082709e](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ezgif-1-d25082709e.webp)\\n\\nIf you review Napper’s paywall, you can see how easily it accommodates all the essentials. Napper’s longform paywall highlights all the things that work for such “landing page” paywalls:\\n\\n- You can easily add elements of social proof (from the number of app users you have to your average app ratings and reviews).\\n- You can better explain your app’s features and benefits, as space isn’t a constraint.\\n- You can better explain the premium version’s value in comparison with the free version.\\n- You can implement conversion tactics like using pricing layouts that kick in the user biases and influence your users’ buying decisions. (More on this later.)\\n- You can address common user concerns via sections like FAQs (think questions around app data privacy, subscriptions, refunds, etc.)\\n\\nHere’s one more example of such a paywall from the Meditopia app:\\n\\n![ezgif 1 a5a7b2eed7](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ezgif-1-a5a7b2eed7.webp)\\n\\nOne obvious challenge with this approach is getting the length of the paywall right: If it’s too long, users can be quick to abandon it. It’s also essential to follow a solid messaging framework when creating the copy. Longform paywalls can also lose users if they don’t use clean and focused layouts.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Modal paywall\\n\\nHere, mobile app paywalls appear as modals or popups. To proceed, users need to either continue with a purchase on the popup or close it.\\n\\nA modal paywall typically gets even lesser space than a standard paywall (that we mentioned above). So if you need to say a lot on your paywall, you must either go with a longform modal or add a carousel.\\n\\nThe [Hinge dating app](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/hinge-dating-relationships) uses a slick modal/popup paywall. As you can see, Hinge goes with the carousel workaround to make up for the lack of space and explain the different benefits of going premium:\\n\\n![6336bfb9879cf767c60d4359 y7ncgfdxoc a9klixlhmsssatac3ai6qdm2gi48rfe khiqetwff8biqykrgdlxexh3mma3aprw7pefjy3iym8pyac9ujns6](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336bfb9879cf767c60d4359_y7ncgfdxoc_a9klixlhmsssatac3ai6qdm2gi48rfe-khiqetwff8biqykrgdlxexh3mma3aprw7pefjy3iym8pyac9ujns6-nfmvwa4wn7wsczp0vc5fumvqeynwva8nsafb0wj5hneub0r_b9t15m4chsc2ixqdgcsb0ct9ipmii7lhhbmtqo0tw.png)\\n\\n### 4\\\\. Trial paywall\\n\\n[Trials are one of the top user acquisition channels for mobile apps.](https://adapty.io/blog/top-reasons-mobile-app-users-go-from-freemium-to-premium) When Google surveyed mobile app users, 17% of the respondents said they moved to premium plans as they ran out of the trial period.\\n\\nWhen it comes to mobile apps, trials work in two ways:\\n\\n1. If it’s a paid app, a user can download the app (for free). But to use the app, they need to sign up for its free trial, which includes agreeing to the billing terms that apply post the trial. A user can, however, cancel the billing agreement anytime during the trial.\\n2. And if it’s a freemium app – which has a fully functional “lite” free version – each time a user tries to access a premium feature, they hit the paywall where they see the option to try the app for free.\\n\\nIn both cases, app stores need app publishers to transparently state the pricing post the trial.\\n\\nSo let’s see what a typical trial paywall looks like. This is Flinch’s simple yet effective trial paywall (Flinch puts you on the annual plan when the trial ends):\\n\\n![6336bfb96d29304fc630bbe0 lo77c3osiy pdlbl s6mxcswqkc4bagqlkau3b6wbi9b8m94a538d4ccvciflrka2hvses9hp18nl9ht0ifb3cpgtzkb6qartmvlyj3k4yjyzxbmusmo5niebu0gpsvi0coz8m vbraj5vzaeyaazfss2f](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336bfb96d29304fc630bbe0_lo77c3osiy_-pdlbl-s6mxcswqkc4bagqlkau3b6wbi9b8m94a538d4ccvciflrka2hvses9hp18nl9ht0ifb3cpgtzkb6qartmvlyj3k4yjyzxbmusmo5niebu0gpsvi0coz8m_vbraj5vzaeyaazfss2f-wys7jql8uecqprkjzr_vxfliv6jpvq.png)\\n\\nBelow you’ll see yet another free trial paywall for a paid app. In addition to “selling” the trial, this app also helps users understand that they’re automatically signing up for a good deal if they take up the trial offer, as the trial is available on the yearly plan (which is noticeably better than the monthly option).\\n\\n![6336bfb9b2a17b6b7ab2748b c1zfvu4kdyzghznr7ittg5nuy0u8td01tvylbnmc848rpergo7fxrncaavpg9nj tydrxfkysek2nsgwywbyulp5wtgwagbybzdgkpe ld hp6 qj 8c7ji b9wujxabon9bgeialeums3ivexwpzlt4e2t591d](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336bfb9b2a17b6b7ab2748b_c1zfvu4kdyzghznr7ittg5nuy0u8td01tvylbnmc848rpergo7fxrncaavpg9nj-tydrxfkysek2nsgwywbyulp5wtgwagbybzdgkpe-ld_hp6_qj-8c7ji_b9wujxabon9bgeialeums3ivexwpzlt4e2t591d-zrexpdxgwl4crboy30g0_2gjnq.png)\\n\\nNo matter how well you explain your trial offer, it can still confuse users. And if they fail to cancel – and you can’t process a refund – you’re looking at critical reviews. Such reviews don’t just affect your app store visibility but also hurt downloads and conversions. The solution? Some app publishers have found the answer in the “timeline” trial paywall.\\n\\nHere we have the language learning app [Loora](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/loora-practice-english-daily) using a beautiful timeline paywall:\\n\\n![6336bfb9af8726d5c803b73d 6lhets q4upxkbyofpbgizb2k4ez2unlllfcv1vhj4ipyztsw1uluradbo oxztmj5qultcrehm5o0eai0oox8cuxwbh2isg3hp3w fdgslx62ijg1 a0f 3oep02a 2dcae](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336bfb9af8726d5c803b73d_6lhets-q4upxkbyofpbgizb2k4ez2unlllfcv1vhj4ipyztsw1uluradbo_oxztmj5qultcrehm5o0eai0oox8cuxwbh2isg3hp3w-fdgslx62ijg1_a0f_3oep02a-2dcae-yk13wx3oly1njvg7wkl375aowmspcrwlb17mlswbrpjxx8fhhgqeg.png)\\n\\nWith this paywall type, users can:\\n\\n- See what they’re getting with the trial\\n- Know that they will be reminded before their trial expires (and before they’re automatically billed)\\n- Learn when they’ll be charged and how much\\n\\nA variation of this timeline paywall type uses a toggle switch and lets users decide if they want to be reminded before their trial ends and they get billed.\\n\\nAs you can tell, for this paywall type to work well, the trial period needs to be just right. Usually, when users get a lengthy trial – say, when they get an app for 3 months – they tend not to use it immediately. They know they have many months to try. As a result, they don’t see the value. On the other hand, a shorter trial forces them to explore the app and decide if they want to get the paid plan or end the trial. The FOMO (fear of missing out) factor kicks in with shorter trials.\\n\\nAll that said, the best way to find the ideal trial length is to test!\\n\\n### 5\\\\. Trial toggle paywall\\n\\nThis is a variation of the trial mobile app paywall with a twist – or a toggle switch.\\n\\nAs with the regular free trial paywall, you offer a free trial here as well. But in this case, you make it optional. So on your paywall, users can either pick a paid plan or choose to unlock a free trial offer by toggling the switch.\\n\\nThe toggle switch makes users feel like they’re getting a risk-free deal. The Lensa: Photo & Video Editor paywall leverages the trial toggle nicely:\\n\\n![6336c0031e40e9d658daab7f 6c upul1fluht2uw itu0zoup4xtpv30 tx3e ykbhgcgnda9xtdn zrcbx3lkcw1z1mveycii7smee5jh4cfjvf8lgsho f7zd7vi5xjbkw0r5egzrscfmq5ghuoz3vuwuxop ttskvidhcayxkotuacqzr agqbamwqtwz hyb1yvrmtqwi3ijga](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c0031e40e9d658daab7f_6c-upul1fluht2uw-itu0zoup4xtpv30-tx3e-ykbhgcgnda9xtdn_zrcbx3lkcw1z1mveycii7smee5jh4cfjvf8lgsho-f7zd7vi5xjbkw0r5egzrscfmq5ghuoz3vuwuxop-ttskvidhcayxkotuacqzr-agqbamwqtwz-hyb1yvrmtqwi3ijga.png)\\n\\n### 6\\\\. Single plan paywall\\n\\nThis might seem surprising, but a vast number of apps only offer a single pricing plan. It’s simple: Here, the app is only available in a single plan, billed weekly, monthly, or yearly. Take the [HotspotShield VPN & Wi-Fi Proxy](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/hotspotshield-vpn-wifi-proxy) app’s paywall, for instance. This paywall offers a single subscription plan – the only one that the app has:\\n\\n![6336c003f798eef0c8d3c0c0 hxpiyvpll8szbyn3ocfbzrtw2b6ih v k0rocfhhpuftvgsjl ffzw4urmzcfioq btbbmqjuddbzgtr8xzrkea6mnupm6awks dbjm4joo6bd1mj30 oxfwss40upzgyjpox6ny5j9rtm0mpckgct 9y3jhryhafilskpth0pyh4hkiepe1iyic5w](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c003f798eef0c8d3c0c0_hxpiyvpll8szbyn3ocfbzrtw2b6ih_v_k0rocfhhpuftvgsjl-ffzw4urmzcfioq_btbbmqjuddbzgtr8xzrkea6mnupm6awks-dbjm4joo6bd1mj30-oxfwss40upzgyjpox6ny5j9rtm0mpckgct-9y3jhryhafilskpth0pyh4hkiepe1iyic5w.png)\\n\\nThe wellness app Calm, too, only comes with one subscription plan:\\n\\n![6336c003af87266c4403bbdd g fscphfahvxb53bnwauywmdaivczqb4w0x1a4yqungw64adc0juwhwzr2k1k2xd9qn3iys3v3y4bg2roso2xi8cerpaq5qsk6sye54t1g dju7y5ywylyxglypmaipd](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c003af87266c4403bbdd__g_fscphfahvxb53bnwauywmdaivczqb4w0x1a4yqungw64adc0juwhwzr2k1k2xd9qn3iys3v3y4bg2roso2xi8cerpaq5qsk6sye54t1g_dju7y5ywylyxglypmaipd-he2djca55sxckv8hyerbeuqzvjejts2lgwzazna6jzz0g8s2nif4npaq.png)\\n\\nOne plus with the single pricing paywall (or app business) is that users don’t need to think and compare multiple plans and choose the one that offers the best value – an exercise that can cure analysis paralysis.\\n\\n### 7\\\\. Multiplan paywall\\n\\nWhen it comes to offering multiple subscription plans, again, there’s no standard way. There are apps offering everything from two to five subscription options. But before we proceed to explore the popular approaches, let’s have a look at the fresh data from [our 2023 report](https://adapty.io/state-of-in-app-subscriptions/) that shows the revenue distribution by the number of products on paywalls.\\n\\n![Products](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Products-1024x723.png)\\n\\nIt’s pretty clear that the most profitable paywall is a combination of 3 products, so it might be a good idea to start from that. However, much depends on the app audience and niche, so it’s not the rule. Make sure to further [check out the 2023 subscription report](https://adapty.io/state-of-in-app-subscriptions/) to find more insights and useful data like this.\\n\\nNow, let’s still take a quick look at the most popular paywall combinations.\\n\\n#### Offering two premium plans\\n\\nThe simplest multiplan pricing structure in mobile apps is offering a monthly plan along with a heavily discounted yearly plan. This is an excellent example of price anchoring: Once the user sees your monthly pricing, they can calculate the value for a year. And then, based on that, the yearly subscription plan looks like an easy decision as it’s usually heavily discounted. The [Asana Rebel app](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/asana-rebel-get-in-shape) does this well:\\n\\n![6336c068a132031869f450e5 xtafnv47wpczhgskgqkvl4kxt li6kczcuxyl55vqtseni 9pcs k7wefnlkkllhpbi v0kcqp7inu4xyqgve jt 0uyorfd6cn hnqgpbedgh](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c068a132031869f450e5_xtafnv47wpczhgskgqkvl4kxt_li6kczcuxyl55vqtseni-9pcs-k7wefnlkkllhpbi_v0kcqp7inu4xyqgve_jt-0uyorfd6cn_hnqgpbedgh-erc2eesesxlhrlbthjyakrl1bla2a2bpvh8cxpjagkhyog5ota0wvzak6sxd0bode1wwpjahnbq.png)\\n\\nThe _“Save 82%”_ tag is difficult to miss. As you can see, the annual plan costs you only $2.99/month compared to the $15.99 you pay for the monthly subscription.\\n\\nHere’s yet another app that offers monthly and annual subscription options, but unlike the above app, [MEYA’s paywall](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/meya-music-and-meditation) doesn’t do any math for the users and doesn’t even try to get users to buy a specific version:\\n\\n![6336c0679694c76d0e9c8b12 khxcn igcmzekmmmiixy4obs4jjirdp7p9sldfssb5zr2sj 5920zd41x2dwkctdmlu1p6c5izmws3qx6phnxqqfkdp1uilqeh ejmfnygewqe9oods2ln5cvaghf1rcebfl0mbn9j6gzmf6wcg8gwjhak lse0rzxhel4biyoibgvf0x880 h qa](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c0679694c76d0e9c8b12_khxcn_igcmzekmmmiixy4obs4jjirdp7p9sldfssb5zr2sj_5920zd41x2dwkctdmlu1p6c5izmws3qx6phnxqqfkdp1uilqeh-ejmfnygewqe9oods2ln5cvaghf1rcebfl0mbn9j6gzmf6wcg8gwjhak-lse0rzxhel4biyoibgvf0x880_h-qa.png)\\n\\nAlso, did you notice that both these apps use charm pricing? Charm pricing takes advantage of the “left digit bias,” which leads people to believe that $2.99 is a more attractive price than $3! Most mobile apps use this charm pricing technique — [check it out for yourself.](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library)\\n\\n#### Offering three plans\\n\\nLook at any SaaS product, and you’ll likely see three plans. Have you ever wondered why businesses always gravitate around the number “3” when offering purchase options?\\n\\nThe answer lies in the decoy effect. With the decoy effect, you have two pricing plans that are noticeably more difficult to consider, given an easy third choice. In fact, the third choice is designed in a way that it appears to be a much better deal than the other options.\\n\\nMobile apps widely use the three-plan scheme. Here, you typically give your users a choice among weekly, monthly, and three-monthly plans. Another hack you get to use with this approach is tagging your best-value plan. Adding visual cues like “most popular” or “best-selling” labels on the plans you want to promote skew your users’ decision. When users see a plan to be the most purchased, they tend to believe it offers the best value. This is also using social proof for selling.\\n\\nThe [Second Phone Number ™ 2nd Line app’s paywall](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/second-phone-number-tm-2nd-line) makes an excellent example of offering multiple paid plans:\\n\\n![6336c068822f04c1097552c5 t4lel4q4uce4sjeb wumeoupyklbn1u tda7invluqh7pfd4xadied7gk2qnys57scys2fz0dwgpurl0dowlvhsa67ihdgbyr8vx3 kcbrtidqsp2pxj9q2jk](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c068822f04c1097552c5_t4lel4q4uce4sjeb_wumeoupyklbn1u_tda7invluqh7pfd4xadied7gk2qnys57scys2fz0dwgpurl0dowlvhsa67ihdgbyr8vx3-kcbrtidqsp2pxj9q2jk-zcpxqbhdoqhg6njfib1l0q41fckkuuv_v7nfad_izcogwgn0shnfwojohwt9j1lw.png)\\n\\nIt’s also common to see monthly, quarterly, and annual plan options. The Go Fasting health app paywall is a noteworthy example:\\n\\n![6336c06840a4462eb53b5ca2 3wkwaosz8v 0bzn8xzqifdk kxkei4 z5u0r7hjhqyl](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c06840a4462eb53b5ca2_3wkwaosz8v_0bzn8xzqifdk_kxkei4-z5u0r7hjhqyl-hu3htqyz7omlt2s85kgwpq5l0nm7przirjl_pxh5rqkportkeabvsynqqjravvmwa03ql3vzhgyi8ui6gxawgtevi9n5_v98lg3xkeloharbg07bqs5vknxahrr7oxn_qq_h7qksqlywqg.png)\\n\\nYou can see this app makes choosing the yearly option almost a no-brainer. Do the math: _For the cost of two months, you’re covered for the entire year._\\n\\nNote that sometimes, the annual discount offer may only apply to the first year. [Memrise’s paywall](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/memrise-fun-language-learning) makes this clear:\\n\\n![6336c0687347d14c446b4853 y08vtgswo29n0ri1jaweeg5l bdqng6xlrnqhsktfd6p18s2vdkzb0f ualjcx0yufdjt 5eyzfzelzgleip9y1nhduvgjifxgc2shlyxu](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c0687347d14c446b4853_y08vtgswo29n0ri1jaweeg5l-bdqng6xlrnqhsktfd6p18s2vdkzb0f_ualjcx0yufdjt_5eyzfzelzgleip9y1nhduvgjifxgc2shlyxu-vga_wwzu4xnbs5diananqqvmq9hjloriyjuhy2jycmvp9rk5f9bsndvc8xyjklsihwhvhsl1ppfnsoq.png)\\n\\nIf this is the case with you, it’s best to state so transparently.\\n\\n#### Offering the lifetime premium option\\n\\nAnother plan that you routinely get to see in premium apps is the lifetime access plan. Here, users get a one-time purchase option along with monthly and annual plans.\\n\\nThe lifetime business model doesn’t suit every app, but it can appeal to many users, especially if they see themselves using the app for some time. The [Motionleap by Lightricks app](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/motionleap-by-lightricks) makes a great example:\\n\\n![6336c0c4b19240d8eeac5bab h9bfglr6uueppzpwnrakgzbxmx4pvbsflfy hw555eklzhxasyng34ysmnskukoogzxgvyl4kbayjcbrzdsdvgnsikjpltj9i](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c0c4b19240d8eeac5bab_h9bfglr6uueppzpwnrakgzbxmx4pvbsflfy_hw555eklzhxasyng34ysmnskukoogzxgvyl4kbayjcbrzdsdvgnsikjpltj9i-bky9slka0ykfrfkl3ezl4uocer1gj03xl6j_kh0etwseyl0tb5crelzberqtaevehcyvsrpw2t_andty8_kdgztg.png)\\n\\nThis app, however, doesn’t push its users to go with the lifetime plan. It’s making the yearly plan look like the winner. Perhaps the lifetime plan is only there to get the users to choose the annual plan, which seems like a better deal.\\n\\nUnlike this app, many apps that offer lifetime plans show them as the plan of choice. [Cosmic Insights Astrology](https://adapty.io/mobile-paywall-library/cosmic-insights-astrology) is one example:\\n\\n![6336c0c45add9a5421c57466 u9oregwnpoktqw1jgfuc mkaaxwhq](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c0c45add9a5421c57466_u9oregwnpoktqw1jgfuc_mkaaxwhq-6lunhmbh1bep3dqud0gf2a8xyedqpebdukmqtjohym445e0ijzjcth_vx1otv6z6bkkuymogprfu8bq4qxth79nffjhn_fblz1k4rng32qcnwrpr6_rvbb29h_pomnpyq3xk_f8yyfe_9cp8100zlf0tuxuq.png)\\n\\n### 8\\\\. Offer paywall\\n\\n_Did you know that 23% of app users upgrade to a paid subscription because of a fantastic upgrade offer?_ Making a great offer is an effective conversion hack, as discounts simply work.\\n\\nThe Balance app uses a smooth offer paywall to get lifetime subscribers. It also prominently promotes its offer throughout the app (see the first screenshot):\\n\\n![6336c0e59694c7775d9c8e7e 1](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c0e59694c7775d9c8e7e_1.png)\\n\\nTerms like “ _for a limited time only_” add an element of scarcity to the offer and get more users to convert.\\n\\nIt’s crucial to sort a few things before planning this paywall, namely:\\n\\n- What discount will work best for your audience?\\n- How will you present your offer? _Get X% off_ vs. _Save X%_ can produce different results! If your users would love to get a discount, the first option will work better. If your users would like to avoid a loss, the second option will be ideal. You need to know your subscribers well to choose messaging that will resonate with them.\\n- Will they value a lifetime offer? If so, how much would they be willing to pay for lifetime access?\\n\\n### 9\\\\. Donation paywall\\n\\nSome app publishers offer very generous trials, often extending for up to a year. And there’s no catch – the fully featured app is for the user to use for the whole year.\\n\\nHowever, most of such apps ask for voluntary contributions. And when the user _chooses_ to pay, they’re presented with the app’s subscription plans or options to pay other amounts.\\n\\nThe mental health app _being_ is a shining example of such a donation paywall:\\n\\n![6336c0fe395c65c4a963d1f3 2](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c0fe395c65c4a963d1f3_2.png)\\n\\nBalance, which also works with the same model, uses a slightly different approach. Here, it explains to its free app users the cost of making the app available for free for a year. And post that, it gives options for contributing:\\n\\n![6336c10bd7f0d782e232324f oflquzcsysp4iwywxgl4x28qy ovqvpcttw95ucacnuluhelcp3idarznkijb17tkwnss9asvb7x2kvicaxvz53on3hjuktrmoeys6nuwj1vwapopjzckv js4qmrattojxzsb fsbhhwnliknferzj5vnrbtjpp6sz](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6336c10bd7f0d782e232324f_oflquzcsysp4iwywxgl4x28qy-ovqvpcttw95ucacnuluhelcp3idarznkijb17tkwnss9asvb7x2kvicaxvz53on3hjuktrmoeys6nuwj1vwapopjzckv_js4qmrattojxzsb_fsbhhwnliknferzj5vnrbtjpp6sz-yrnx2pnzpkepihxzawen5a.png)\\n\\nThis helps users decide how much of a donation they must make if they want to support the app. It’s a clever nudge to inspire users to make a meaningful contribution.\\n\\n### 10\\\\. Personalized mobile app paywall\\n\\nThe personalized mobile app paywall is a special kind of paywall. Here you pick your most popular user segments and [design the paywalls](https://adapty.io/for-marketers/) customized for them.\\n\\nHere’s how it works:\\n\\nFirst, you identify different segments that exist in your audience. With an app SDK solution like Adapty it’s pretty easy:\\n\\n![Tiralss](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tiralss-1024x654.png)\\n\\nNext, you hypothesize messaging, layouts, and offers that will likely work best for each segment. Note that you’d want to create two versions (A and B) for each segment.\\n\\nFinally, you add the paywalls you prepared inside your test builds and then show each segment the paywall personalized for them:\\n\\n![AB test](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AB-test-1024x705.png)\\n\\n### Paywall types comparison\\n\\n| Paywall Type | Best Use Case | Main Advantage | Key Risk | Typical Apps |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Full-screen static | Simple offers | Fast clarity | Low flexibility | Utilities |\\n| Scrollable landing | Complex value prop | Strong persuasion | Longer time to convert | Wellness |\\n| Trial paywall | Lower entry barrier | High CVR | Low ARPU risk | Fitness |\\n| Multi-plan | Price anchoring | Higher ARPU | Decision overload | SaaS |\\n| Contextual | Feature-driven | High intent | Limited reach | Editors |\\n\\n## Wrapping it up…\\n\\nAs we just saw, each paywall type has its strengths and challenges. And depending on your use case, one As we’ve seen, each paywall type comes with its own strengths and trade-offs, and the best choice depends on your specific use case. There is no universal solution. The optimal paywall is the one that aligns with your app’s business model, user behavior, and monetization goals.\\n\\nTo find the right paywall type for your mobile app, start by forming hypotheses about which options may work best. Use insights from your business model, primary conversion channels, and existing user data to guide these assumptions. From there, run controlled experiments to identify the paywalls that drive the highest revenue and long-term value.\\n\\nHowever, paywall optimization does not start at the paywall itself. The way users are onboarded into your app plays a critical role in how they perceive value and whether they are ready to convert.\\n\\nWith **[Adapty’s App Onboarding Builder](https://adapty.io/onboarding-builder/)**, you can design and customize onboarding flows that introduce users to your app’s core value before they ever reach a paywall. By highlighting key features, benefits, and use cases early on, onboarding screens help warm up users and increase their likelihood of converting once a paywall is shown.\\n\\nOnce users are in the app, **[Adapty Autopilot](https://adapty.io/autopilot/)** helps take monetization optimization a step further. Autopilot automatically adapts paywalls, pricing, and offers based on user behavior and performance data. Instead of manually managing experiments, you can let Autopilot continuously optimize paywall experiences to maximize conversions, in-app purchases, and subscriptions.\\n\\nTogether, Adapty’s paywall management, onboarding customization, and automated optimization tools allow you to experiment across the entire user journey, from first launch to purchase, and continuously improve your app’s monetization performance.\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### What is a paywall in a mobile app?\\n\\nA paywall is a screen or flow that limits access to premium features or content until the user subscribes or makes a purchase. It communicates the value of the paid offering and prompts users to convert from free to paid. Paywalls are commonly used in subscription-based mobile apps such as fitness, productivity, education, and media apps.\\n\\n### What is the difference between a paywall and a purchase screen?\\n\\nA paywall is a marketing and conversion screen designed to explain the value of a subscription or premium access before the purchase. A purchase screen, on the other hand, is a transactional interface provided by the app store where the user completes the payment. In short, the paywall persuades, while the purchase screen processes the payment.\\n\\n### What is a hard paywall vs a soft paywall?\\n\\nA hard paywall blocks access to the app or its core features until the user subscribes. A soft paywall allows users to explore the app or access limited functionality before prompting them to pay. Soft paywalls are often more user-friendly and work well for onboarding and long-term retention, while hard paywalls are typically used when the value proposition is immediately clear.\\n\\n### Which paywall type converts best for subscription apps?\\n\\nThere is no single best paywall type for all subscription apps. However, trial-based paywalls and contextual paywalls often show higher conversion rates because they reduce friction and target users with high intent. The most effective approach depends on the app category, audience behavior, and how clearly the value is demonstrated. A/B testing is essential to identify the best-performing paywall for a specific app.\\n\\n### How many subscription options should be shown on a paywall?\\n\\nIn most cases, showing two or three subscription options works best. This allows for price anchoring without overwhelming users. Common combinations include monthly, yearly, and lifetime plans, with one option visually highlighted as the best value. Too many choices can increase cognitive load and reduce conversion rates.\\n\\n### How often should paywalls be updated or tested?\\n\\nPaywalls should be tested and optimized on an ongoing basis. Many subscription apps run A/B tests every few weeks or at least once per quarter. Updates are especially important after changes in pricing, app positioning, audience targeting, or store policies. Continuous experimentation helps adapt paywalls to user behavior and maximize conversion and revenue over time.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

And speaking their language is not easy.\\n\\nWhen you’re selling your app, you’re looking at it as your baby — that project where you allocated so many hours, went back and forth with ideas, and asked for support from different friends to make it happen.\\n\\nBut buyers don’t see it the same way — buyers are investors. And they see your app as a simple asset composed of lines of code and a marketing engine.\\n\\nMy firm’s role is to find a common ground where both parties can get what they want.\\n\\nIn this article, I elaborate more on the questions every developer aiming for an exit has:\\n\\n- What platforms should you develop for\\n- How distribution channels can boost your app valuation\\n- And how to calculate the value of your app (a template provided)\\n\\nThis article is for you, the builders who are ready for an exit.\\n\\n## What platforms should you develop apps in?\\n\\niOS is definitely trendy in the #buildinpublic and developer community in general. But in reality, there’s a demand for an Android market that is underserved, too.\\n\\nWeb is also relevant when it comes to web-to-app funnels and app-to-web funnels (higher subscriber retention, lower platform fees), and also to support retaining your users by providing a broader experience with different functionalities and features.\\n\\nSomething I’m currently seeing in the market that doesn’t appeal to buyers is apps that are solely live on iOS with a single distribution channel, for example, TikTok influencer marketing.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nThe entire business relies heavily on two platforms, which are not under the buyers’ control: Apple can make any changes, TikTok algorithm can change too, and if any of that happens, your business is screwed.\\n\\nIt’s fine if iOS is the primary source of revenue for your app, but **you will have a stronger case if you distribute and convert through other platforms too**.\\n\\nThis also broadens your potential buyer spectrum, since you will cover the ones that favor iOS, the ones that favor Android, and the ones who prefer both.\\n\\n## Do you need AI in your app to boost its valuation?\\n\\nAI tech ≠ AI wrappers:\\n\\n- AI tech is shaping the future.\\n- AI wrappers are jumping on the hype wave of AI, but as it was with the WWW and with Web3, only the best ones will thrive.\\n\\nAs a developer who wants to exit, you need to consider if your business will be valuable five years from now, when the AI hype subsides. Don’t build your entire business around AI. Build it around real problems that won’t lose relevance over time.\\n\\nMost buyers want to see AI involved in your offering, either in processes, tech, product, or distribution. But **AI as a moat happens only when you have advanced technology** that is harder to replicate.\\n\\nAn interesting highlight from a [SensorTower](https://sensortower.com/report/2025-state-of-mobile-tiktok-edition) report presents the following: _IAP revenue from AI Chatbot and AI Art Generators climbed from $30 million in 2022 to $455 million in 2023 to nearly $1.3 billion in 2024. Downloads saw a similar trajectory, approaching 1.5 billion in 2024. \\\\[…\\\\] Sixteen different Generative AI apps reached at least $10 million in IAP revenue in 2024, and 25 had more than 10 million downloads._\\n\\nBut there’s a catch…the biggest piece of cake is going to OpenAI.\\n\\nOne thing that will definitely stand the test of time is code quality. When buyers show interest in your app, metrics and ARR matter, but they also need to look under the hood. If a CTO on the buyer’s side sees that your code won’t hold up under heavy user traffic, that’s a hard no.\\n\\n## How do distribution strategies affect an app’s valuation?\\n\\nBuyers know paid ads. They scaled their own companies or saw their employment companies scale by increasing spend on Meta and Google.\\n\\nBut they lack and don’t know how to set up a successful influencer growth engine: they are not Gen Z, and they are not scrolling on TikTok, so it’s an unnatural and hard-to-crack traffic source. This makes apps with this influencer engine already built an interesting asset for them to look at, since these apps:\\n\\n- Include a new user acquisition source in their growth stack\\n- Benefit from the winning creative messages and assets to scale paid UA in an efficient and profitable way\\n- Potentially lower the CPIs across their entire portfolio — I’ve seen clients pay $0.15–$0.20 per install on TikTok or Instagram. By comparison, U.S. paid channels often cost $2–$5 per install.\\n\\nTip for devs: try to translate your growth efforts into CPI and CAC — this will facilitate buyers to compare apples to apples and move forward faster.\\n\\nIf you’re growing through influencer marketing, use a dashboard or third-party tool to log creators, impressions, installs, payouts, and conversion rates. Influencer growth should look for them as easy to understand and plug into their stack as a Meta Business dashboard.\\n\\nAnother thing they LOVE is organic traffic from the stores: if you’re highly ranked for relevant keywords and get thousands of installs every month courtesy of Apple and Google, they will love it even if you’re not monetizing them very well.\\n\\nThis is not all for organic growth!\\n\\nThink also of referrals of any type (discounts, Instagram stories sharing, friends challenges) and niche partnerships with cool brands.\\n\\nAnd always think like a buyer! They invest for the next three to five years. Viral trends might not be as sexy, but organic tactics with real engagement and clear metrics will thrive.\\n\\n## How to get a valuation for your app?\\n\\n[**We created this template for you**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mQeKRlBu8ogSpuNLkpSywErezlroa2L5h_Jif8onZOc/edit?usp=sharing) **to fill out and get a potential valuation.** Just copy the spreadsheet to your Google Drive and add your data.\\n\\n![PL](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/07/PL-1024x380.png)\\n\\nFirst, you need to create a P&L for the last 12 months of the business, including a monthly breakdown of:\\n\\n- The monetization strategy (subscriptions, IAP)\\n- The number of subscribers/users per platform (iOS vs Android vs Web)\\n- Monthly revenue\\n- All expenses, including third-party tools, employees/freelancers, marketing spending, and other costs\\n\\nThen, once the P&L is ready, you will have your total annual EBITDA.\\n\\nApp businesses are — in most cases — valued based on either the amount of profit or the number of users. In the case that you’re selling based on profit, standard multipliers are 1-7x on annual profit.\\n\\nWhere you fall in the range will depend on your profit margins, maintenance needed, competitor landscape, MoM growth, among others.\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### What platforms should my app be on to interest serious buyers?\\n\\nBuyers like diversity. You can start on iOS, but Android is underserved and web still matters. That gives you growth funnels, better subscriber retention, and lower fees. Do not rely only on iOS and TikTok influencer marketing – Apple or TikTok can change rules suddenly, and then your business is in trouble.\\n\\n### Do I need AI in my app to raise value?\\n\\nMost buyers expect some AI. But AI wrappers are just hype. Only deeper AI tech that solves real problems and is hard to copy creates lasting value. Focus on real needs, not trends, so it still matters when AI buzz ends. And code quality is always more important than fancy features.\\n\\n### How do distribution methods boost valuation?\\n\\nBuyers know paid ads but most do not know influencer marketing. If you already have a working TikTok or Instagram creator-based engine, that is rare and valuable. Track installations, impressions, creators, costs (CPI, CAC) clearly. Organic store traffic, referrals and niche partnerships also score big. Buyers love predictable metrics over viral flukes.\\n\\n### How to calculate my app’s valuation?\\n\\nFirst, make a P&L for last 12 months: revenue by platform (iOS, Android, web), number of users or subscribers, monthly revenue, all expenses. Compute EBITDA. Then multiply profit by **1 to 7** depending on your margins, growth, how much upkeep it needs, and how crowded the market is.\\n\\n### How to show influencer growth in a format buyers understand?\\n\\nUse a dashboard or third‑party tool to log creators, impressions, installs, costs, payouts, conversion rates. Present it like a Meta Business dashboard. Then buyers can plug it easily into their stack.\\n\\n[Evelin on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelinherrera/) [Evelin on X](https://x.com/herreraevel)\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

And with all the offers you’re getting, it’s hard not to give in to a few subscriptions here and there.\\n\\nIf you’re struggling with justifying the costs of it all, let me deliver the good news. With “Family Sharing,” you can enjoy purchase sharing with family members and close friends. This way, you save some cash and can easily manage multiple subscriptions with a digital app library!\\n\\nNow how does one get all that? Let’s start by setting up your family group!\\n\\n![image 25](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-25-1024x682.png)\\n\\n## How to set up a family group?\\n\\nSetting up a family group can look different, depending on the operating system and platform you’re using. You’ll have to fulfill some basic prerequisites of family sharing, such as:\\n\\n- The family organizer/manager should be 18 years or older,\\n- The family members must be 13 years or older,\\n- All family members must have an account on Google Play or Apple App Store,\\n- The family organizer/manager should have a valid payment method.\\n\\nOn Google Play, go to the Family tab within Settings and click on “ [Sign up for Family Group.](https://play.google.com/family/create?hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)” You can add the members using their Google account details and you’ll have a family group ready to go.\\n\\nOn App Store, you’ll have to click on your Apple ID within the Settings app. Once there, tap on “Family Sharing” and then “Set up your family.” Voila, you’ve got a family group ready to share some purchases!\\n\\n![image 21](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-21.png)\\n\\n### Setting up family sharing on iOS\\n\\nWhen it comes to iOS, you’ll find purchase sharing within the settings app as “Family Sharing.” At one time, a family group can have 6 members, all of whom require a valid Apple ID to enjoy sharing in-app purchases.\\n\\n![image 24](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-24-1024x934.png)\\n\\n1. Open the Settings app on your iOS device.\\n2. Tap on your Apple ID at the top of the screen.\\n3. Select “Family Sharing” from the menu.\\n4. Tap “Get Started” and follow the prompts to set up your family group.\\n5. Choose the features you want to share with your family members, such as In-App Purchases, Apple Music, iCloud Storage, and more.\\n6. Invite family members to join your group by sending them an invitation for purchase sharing through the Family Sharing settings. You’ll need their Apple ID for this part and they’ll need to accept the invite on their devices!\\n7. Once everyone is part of the group, you can start sharing your purchases, subscriptions, and other features with each other.\\n\\n![image 23](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-506x1024.png)\\n\\n### Setting up a family library on Google Play\\n\\nIf you’re an Android type of guy, you’ve got the power to share your subscriptions too! In Google Play, you’ll find in-app purchase sharing to be under the title of “Family Library.”\\n\\n1. Open the Google Play app on your Android device.\\n2. Tap on the menu icon in the upper-left corner of the screen and select “Account.”\\n3. Select “Family” from the list of options.\\n4. Tap “Sign up for Family Library” and follow the prompts to set up your family group.\\n5. Invite family members to join your group by sending them an invitation through the Family Library settings, through their Google accounts.\\n6. Once everyone is part of the group, you can start sharing your eligible purchases with each other.\\n7. To share an item, go to the item’s page on the Google Play Store and tap “Share.”\\n8. Select “Family Library” and choose the family members you want to share the item with.\\n\\n[![demo page 3 3](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/demo-page-3-3-1024x286.png)](https://adapty.io/schedule-demo/)\\n\\n## How to share in-app purchases with family members\\n\\nOnce you’ve successfully set up your family library or group, it’s time to share. But keep in mind, you can’t share each and every in-app purchase with your family. Each platform comes with its own set of restrictions on what you can and can’t share.\\n\\nReady to jump into purchase sharing on different platforms?\\n\\n### Sharing in-app purchases on iOS\\n\\n1. Ensure that Family Sharing is enabled on your device. You can check this by going to Settings, tapping on your name, and selecting “Family Sharing.”\\n2. Next, open the App Store and tap on your profile picture in the top right corner.\\n3. Select “Purchased” and then choose the app with the in-app purchase you want to share.\\n4. Tap on the app and scroll down until you see “In-App Purchases.”\\n5. Tap the “Share” icon next to the purchase you want to share.\\n6. Select the family member(s) you want to share the in-app purchase with and tap “Send.”\\n\\n![image 20](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-20.png)\\n\\n### Sharing in-app purchases on Google Play\\n\\nGoogle Play offers a similarly easy path to enjoying **purchase sharing** with your family and friends. Once you’ve got a family group set up in the app, follow these steps to share your in-app purchases:\\n\\n1. Open the Google Play app and go to the “My Apps & Games” section.\\n2. Select the app that contains the in-app purchase you want to share.\\n3. Tap on the in-app purchase you want to share and select “Share.”\\n4. Choose the family members you want to share the in-app purchase with and tap “Send.”\\n\\nConsumable in-app purchases, such as game currency or lives, can’t be shared. Non-consumable in-app purchases, such as unlocking a feature or removing ads, can be shared among family members.\\n\\nShared in-app purchases will be visible to all family members in your Family Library so you may want to refrain from adding anything that you don’t want others to see! Additionally, shared purchases may not be available in all countries or regions.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting common issues\\n\\nOnce you’re finally done setting up your family sharing, you’re expecting smooth sailing… And here comes an error popup! It can be frustrating when other family members cant access your in-app purchases.\\n\\nFrom unauthorized access problems to restricted sharing, here are some of the most common issues when it comes to sharing purchases.\\n\\n### In-app purchases not appearing for family members\\n\\nThis one’s perhaps the most common question asked in Apple support communities and can be easily solved on your own! You can easily solve this issue and enjoy family sharing with these steps:\\n\\n- **Verify Family Sharing Settings:** Ensure that Family Sharing is set up correctly and that all members are linked to the same account. Check the settings app to ensure that purchase sharing is enabled.\\n- **Confirm Apple ID:** Make sure that the correct Apple ID is being used to make the purchase. If the wrong ID is being used, the purchase may not be visible to other family members.\\n- **Check for Restrictions:** Some in-app purchases may be restricted by content rating or other limitations. Verify that the restrictions are not preventing the purchase from appearing for all family members.\\n- **Log Out and Log In:** Try logging out of the App Store and then logging back in again. This may help refresh the purchase data and allow it to appear for all family members.\\n- **Contact Apple Support:** If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact Apple Support for assistance. They can help troubleshoot the issue further and provide additional solutions if necessary.\\n\\n![image 22](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22.png)\\n\\n### Family members unable to access shared in-app purchases\\n\\nIf your other family members aren’t able to access Family Sharing of app purchases, you can follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:\\n\\n- **Verify Sharing Settings:** Ensure that Family Sharing is set up correctly and that all members are linked to the same account. Check the settings to ensure that purchase sharing is enabled.\\n- **Confirm Payment Method:** Verify that the payment method associated with the shared account is up to date and has sufficient funds to cover the purchase.\\n- **Check App Store Updates:** Make sure that all family members updated their App Store to the latest version. Sometimes outdated versions can cause issues with Apple family sharing.\\n- **Log Out and Log In:** Try logging out of the App Store and then logging back in again. This may help refresh the purchase data and allow access to the shared In-App Purchase.\\n- **Check for Restrictions:** Some In-App Purchases may be restricted by content rating or other limitations. Verify that the restrictions are not preventing access to shared purchases.\\n- **Contact Apple Support:** At the end of the day if nothing works, contact Apple Support for assistance. They can help troubleshoot the issue further and provide additional solutions if necessary.\\n\\n### Family Sharing support by purchase type\\n\\n| Purchase type | Family Sharing supported | Notes |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| One-time IAP | Yes | Must be explicitly enabled |\\n| Auto-renewable subscriptions | Yes | Optional, controlled by developer |\\n| Non-renewing subscriptions | No | Not supported |\\n| Consumables | No | Never shareable |\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAnd there you have it! Every way you can share your in-app purchases with your family. Not only is family sharing an amazing way to save money but also efficient organizing. Share your app subscriptions with ease and keep parental control over your children with “Family Sharing!”\\n\\nSetting up a family group is easy. All you need are Apple IDs or Google Account details of your family members to add them to a family group. With easy settings to enable in-app purchase sharing, you can start instantly!\\n\\nOh… and if you bump into the occasional error, you can troubleshoot the issue on your own most of the time.\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### Can all in-app purchases be shared with family members?\\n\\nNo, not all in-app purchases can be shared with family members. It depends on the app developer and whether they have enabled the “Family Sharing” feature. Usually, non-consumable purchases such as ad removal and premium features are shareable with your family!\\n\\n### How many family members can I share my in-app purchases with?\\n\\nOn iOS, up to six family members can share in-app purchases through the “Family Sharing” feature. On Google Play, up to five family members can share in-app purchases using the “Google Play Family Library” feature.\\n\\n### Are there any age restrictions for sharing in-app purchases with family members?\\n\\nTo keep everyone safe, Google Play and iOS have set up age restrictions on sharing in-app purchases. Both platforms require the family organizer/manager to be at least 18 years old with a valid payment method. Google Play also requires the family members to be at least 13 years old and living in the same country as the family manager.\\n\\n### What happens if a family member leaves the family group?\\n\\nIf a family member leaves the family group, they will lose access to any shared in-app purchases. The remaining members will still have access to the shared purchases. However, the departing member can regain access to those purchases by rejoining the group or paying full price for it individually!\\n\\n### Can I share in-app purchases across different platforms (iOS and Android)?\\n\\nNo, in-app purchases are typically tied to the platform’s ecosystem and can’t be shared across different platforms (such as iOS and Android). This means that purchases made on one platform can’t be transferred or shared with users on a different platform.\\n\\n### How do I handle refunds for shared in-app purchases?\\n\\nOn both Google Play and iOS, refunds for shared in-app purchases are issued to the account that made the original purchase. If a family member requests a refund, it will be credited to the original account holder’s payment method. Refunds are only available via contacting the app store’s customer service within a certain timeframe and understandable explanation.\\n\\n### Can I choose which in-app purchases to share with specific family members?\\n\\nYes, it’s possible to selectively share in-app purchases with specific family members. On both iOS and Google Play, the family organizer or manager can choose which purchases to share with each family member and manage the sharing settings through the Family Sharing or Google Play Family Library feature.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Kharlan](https://adapty.io/author/vkharlan/)\\n\\nPublished September 18, 2025\\n\\nLast updated October 21, 2025\\n\\n4 min read\\n\\n![Adapty Finance](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/09/adapty_finance_cover@1x.jpg)\\n\\n**_TL;DR_** _: Apple pays you 45 days late. Google takes 30. Meanwhile, your best campaigns are running out of budget. Adapty Finance unlocks up to 85% of your earned revenue within 1-2 days. No loans, no equity, zero platform risk._\\n\\nYou’re hitting your numbers. User acquisition works. Revenue climbs month over month. But here’s what actually happens: you’re always 6 weeks behind your own success.\\n\\nApple pays 45 days after the month-end. Google takes 30. While you wait, your best campaigns stall, your team slows down, and competitors with faster cash flow pull ahead.\\n\\nWe’ve seen this story hundreds of times working with Adapty customers. You’ve got proven unit economics, clear growth levers, and the data to back it up, but you’re artificially constrained by payment timing that made sense in 2008, not 2025.\\n\\nThat’s why we built Adapty Finance.\\n\\n## What is Adapty Finance?\\n\\nAdapty Finance transforms your earned-but-not-yet-paid App Store and Google Play revenue into immediate working capital.\\n\\nThis isn’t a loan. It’s not equity financing. It’s your money, faster.\\n\\n**Here’s how it works:**\\n\\n1. Your app generates subscription revenue.\\n2. We advance you up to 85% of that earned revenue within 1-2 business days.\\n3. When stores pay out on their normal schedule, we collect our advance plus a transparent fee.\\n4. You get the remaining balance the same day stores settle with us.\\n\\n**The result:** Your revenue cycles 4-6x faster instead of waiting for payment schedules that don’t match how growth works today.\\n\\n## Why did we build this?\\n\\nOver the past five years helping thousands of apps optimize their subscription revenue, we kept hearing the same frustration:\\n\\n_“We know exactly which campaigns drive profitable users. We have the LTV data. We could 2x our ad spend profitably tomorrow, if we just had the cash flow to do it.”_\\n\\nTraditional financing doesn’t work for app businesses. Banks don’t understand subscription metrics. VCs want equity for what should be a simple cash flow tool. Invoice factoring companies think “App Store Connect” is some kind of networking event.\\n\\nBut we understand your business model inside and out. We’ve seen your revenue patterns, your seasonal fluctuations, your churn curves. We know the difference between healthy growth constraints and actual problems.\\n\\nSo we decided to solve this ourselves.\\n\\nHere’s what we built:\\n\\n## Real-world impact\\n\\nLet’s run through a realistic scenario:\\n\\n**Meditation app – January performance:**\\n\\n- Monthly recurring revenue: $85,000\\n- New user acquisition cost: $12\\n- 6-month LTV: $47\\n- ROAS target: 120%+\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Traditional timing** | **With Adapty Finance** |\\n| January revenue earned: $85,000 | January revenue earned: $85,000 |\\n| Apple payout arrives: Mid-March | Advance available February 1st: $72,250 (85% of earned revenue) |\\n| Available for February ad spend: Whatever’s left in the bank (maybe $30K?) | Apple payout arrives March: We collect our fee, forward your remaining balance<br>Available for February ad spend: $72K+ instead of $30K |\\n| Growth constraint: Severe | Growth constraint: Eliminated |\\n\\nThat extra $40K+ in February ad spend, with proven 120% ROAS, generates an additional $48K in February revenue. Which becomes available for March 1st. Which compounds again in March.\\n\\nThe founders are breaking the artificial ceiling on their growth trajectory.\\n\\n## Security and compliance\\n\\n**The question we get most: “Is this safe for my developer accounts?”**\\n\\nAbsolutely. Adapty Finance operates as a legitimate financial intermediary, similar to how banks factor invoices or how Stripe Capital advances against payment processing volume.\\n\\nWe’re not manipulating app store algorithms, violating terms of service, or creating any platform risk. Your relationship with Apple and Google remains exactly the same. The stores pay us directly (with your authorization), we take our agreed portion, and immediately forward your remaining balance.\\n\\nFrom Apple’s and Google’s perspective, you’ve simply updated your payment recipient, which is completely normal and supported in their standard business processes.\\n\\n## Eligibility and requirements\\n\\n### **Who can apply:**\\n\\n- Mobile app founders with $15,000+ monthly revenue\\n- Must be incorporated as a legal entity (individual developers excluded due to licensing requirements)\\n- Apps distributed through major stores (Apple App Store, Google Play)\\n- Standard business documentation for verification\\n\\n### **Application process:**\\n\\n1. Schedule a call with an Adapty Finance representative.\\n2. Provide required business documentation.\\n3. Review and sign agreement.\\n4. Receive first advance within 1-2 business days.\\n\\n### **Advance terms:**\\n\\n- **Amount:** Up to 85% of earned revenue per fiscal period\\n- **Speed:** 1-2 business days from approval\\n- **Frequency:** Weekly or on-demand draws available\\n- **Fee structure:** Transparent fixed percentage on advanced amounts\\n- **No hidden costs:** No setup fees, maintenance charges, or surprise penalties\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nReady to break free from payment schedule constraints?\\n\\nThe application process is straightforward, with most approvals completed within 24 hours of document submission.\\n\\n[**Schedule your consultation →**](https://calendly.com/mkreidich/adapty-finance)\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### My app is growing but I’m always cash-strapped for marketing. What are my options?\\n\\nInstead of waiting 30-45 days for store payouts, Adapty Finance can unlock up to 85% of your earned revenue within 1-2 days. This means your January earnings can fuel February ad spend instead of sitting in Apple’s accounting system.\\n\\n### Will getting advances on my app revenue affect my developer account?\\n\\nNo. Adapty Finance operates as a legitimate payment processor, similar to how Stripe handles payments. From Apple and Google’s perspective, you’ve simply updated where they send your money, which is completely standard.\\n\\n### I’m already using business loans or investors. Why consider revenue advances?\\n\\nUnlike generic business loans or equity investors, Adapty Finance is designed specifically for subscription businesses. We integrate with your existing analytics, offer terms based on your actual revenue patterns, and don’t require equity or personal guarantees.\\n\\n### What if my app revenue is seasonal or inconsistent?\\n\\nAdapty Finance advances are based on money you’ve already earned, not projections. During slower months, your available advance automatically adjusts down. During peak months, you get more capital exactly when you need it most.\\n\\n### How quickly can I get access to my earned app revenue?\\n\\nOnce approved, Adapty Finance delivers advances within 1-2 business days. The approval process itself usually takes 24 hours after you submit standard business documents.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

This is so for several reasons. To start with, these apps target lucrative markets like gaming. Mobile gamers are projected to increase by 8%, reaching 137 million users by 2027. High download rates in the segment translate to substantial revenue (sometimes simply through ads alone).\\n\\nThese apps also mostly use the hybrid monetization model, which involves tapping multiple monetization methods. Take lifestyle apps, for instance. Lifestyle apps can generate revenue through in-app purchases, subscriptions, and partnerships with other companies, in addition to monetizing via ads. This model allows for a diversified revenue stream and better overall profitability.\\n\\nLastly, these apps keep their target consumer behavior in mind, catering to users willing to spend money on apps. For example, a good share of users of healthcare apps are prepared to pay to achieve their fitness goals.\\n\\n| Revenue source | Description | Examples |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Subscriptions | Recurring payments on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis | Netflix, Duolingo |\\n| Advertising | Revenue from impressions or clicks | Casual games, social apps |\\n| In-app purchases | One-time or repeat purchases inside the app | Game currencies, boosters |\\n| Transaction fees | Percentage taken from each transaction | E-commerce and marketplace apps |\\n\\nSo, let’s see the types of mobile apps that make the most money and the different monetization strategies they use. (Even if your app serves a niche market, you can still apply monetization ideas from these top-grossing app segments to monetize your app better.) Here goes.\\n\\n## The 9 types of apps that make the most money\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Mobile games\\n\\nThe [average revenue per user (ARPU)](https://adapty.io/blog/average-revenue-per-unit-arpu/) in the mobile gaming app segment is expected to hit [US$57.64 this year](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/video-games/mobile-games/worldwide) (and US$64.26 by 2027). And given that [a gaming app, on average, has about 160 monthly active users](https://www.statista.com/topics/1906/mobile-gaming/#topicOverview), there’s definitely money in the niche.\\n\\n_So, how do mobile gaming apps monetize?_ The majority of mobile gaming apps follow the free-to-play (FTP) model, so they’re free to download. The most popular monetization methods are ads and in-app purchases, with progressing in the game being the most effective driver for in-app purchases. Other reasons driving in-app purchases across the three main spender categories — high-value spenders, mid-value spenders, and low-value spenders — include in-game currencies/gems, limited-time offers/deals, and extra energy/lives/hints, [among others](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1463190/us-canada-mobile-gaming-top-iap-types/). In general, subscriptions [aren’t gaming apps’ primary monetization model](https://www.ey.com/en_ch/technology/how-can-mobile-game-developers-devise-a-winning-game-monetization-strategy):\\n\\n![most money making mobile apps games](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/most-money-making-mobile-apps-games-1024x606.png)\\n\\nAlso, as such, there are no “most popular” subcategories in the mobile gaming apps segment, as hypercasual apps across all kinds of subcategories tend to do well. This means you’ve got the opportunity to choose pretty much any subcategory for building your gaming app. However, gaming user behavior across the app funnel varies greatly between subcategories. For example:\\n\\n- Casual games can find users more easily, but you’ve to rely mostly on ads for monetization.\\n- Acquiring (and converting) casino game app users, on the other hand, can be expensive.\\n- Lifestyle games also come with a high cost per install.\\n\\nIt’s important to factor all these in when planning your gaming app.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Social apps\\n\\nSocial media apps too make a lot of money. However, like the entertainment apps we’ll see in the next section, the social media app space is extremely competitive, and the most popular titles take the majority of the revenue.\\n\\nThat said, the social media app landscape isn’t just about the most popular social networks. There’s a place for niche apps connecting all kinds of communities. You’ve niche social media apps for connecting communities like political enthusiasts, those belonging to the same religion, or those leading a certain kind of lifestyle (digital nomads, for instance). Think of these loosely as niche “interest-based social networks.”\\n\\nSuch social apps can be profitable through various revenue methods, such as ads, subscriptions, or in-app purchases, depending on their target audience and purpose. Many social apps also let users monetize their content/digital products.\\n\\nYou also have many “hybrid” social apps in this segment. While these apps target a specific area (stargazing, for example), they make “community” a big part of their app. By striking a balance between their core features and their general social networking features, they let users pursue their interests while connecting with like-minded individuals as part of a broader community.  Such apps attract a diverse user base and can generate a good revenue through a combination of different monetization methods. To succeed, however, these apps need to know how to effectively monetize their user engagement.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Subscription-based entertainment apps\\n\\nWhen it comes to subscription-based entertainment apps, you’re mainly looking at content streaming apps. However, while these apps generate some of the highest revenues in the mobile app space, building one may not be for most developers or even for many of the established app studios, for that matter. That’s because of how their business model works. You’re looking at content production, licensing, and other complex logistics.\\n\\nIn addition to all that, the most popular apps that take away all of the niche’s revenue already have loyal users. Think Netflix, Spotify, and Hotstar, to name a few. So you can understand why this segment doesn’t see that many new entrants.\\n\\nBut even though this segment isn’t for everyone, any app that uses subscriptions for monetizing can learn from these apps’ monetization strategies.\\n\\n![Subscription Apps](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2024/06/subscription-apps-1024x576.webp)\\n\\n### 4\\\\. E-commerce and marketplace apps\\n\\nYet another app segment that sees good revenue is eCommerce. As new audience segments emerge, you’re getting to see several new entrants in the space. In fact, identifying underserved niches and catering to specific interests or demographics are how the new entrants are actually differentiating themselves from the existing mainstream apps and attracting and retaining dedicated user bases for themselves. Because otherwise, this, too, like all the other profitable niches in this list, is saturated with many big players. The newer entrants basically tap trends that are likely to hold.\\n\\nOne such trend is opting for clean, sustainable, and socially-conscious choices. More and more new eCommerce apps are carving out a place for themselves by targeting this lifestyle, offering curated selections of all-natural, organic, and sustainable products, catering specifically to consumers who are looking for clean and sustainable options. By focusing on this niche market, these new entrants are able to differentiate themselves from larger etailers and appeal to a dedicated customer base seeking environmentally friendly products. Clean beauty/skincare is just one example.\\n\\nThese apps make money in many ways:\\n\\n- Subscriptions\\n- Ads from partner brands\\n- Transaction fees\\n\\nThis trend toward conscious consumerism is only expected to grow as more people prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions, so this category should see more apps.\\n\\n### 5\\\\. Dating apps\\n\\nWhile both the top apps in the niche (Tinder and Bumble) have seen a slump in their market value, the dating niche still remains promising. Before we see how dating apps monetize, let’s understand the demographic shift that’s causing the slump. When the dating apps first grew, they targeted millennials… and most millennials are now married. This [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/business/dating-apps-tinder-bumble.html) explains what’s happened really well:\\n\\n> “Millennials, the nation’s largest generation, were prime dating age when Tinder first rolled out, but more and more of them have married in recent years, a decision that usually results in people quitting the apps. Now the primary users are from Gen Z, a younger — and smaller — demographic with less disposable income. That generational shift poses a challenge for the dating app industry.”\\n\\n![explanation guidance for what types of apps make the most money adapty google docs 1](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/explanation-guidance-for-what-types-of-apps-make-the-most-money-adapty-google-docs-1.png)\\n\\nTo navigate this challenge, dating apps are having to experiment with how they monetize. Traditionally, dating apps have made money through 1) straightforward premium subscriptions, 2) in-app purchases for additional features like spotlights, and 3) advertising. The bigger apps also sold their own merchandise.\\n\\nHowever, there’s now a need to experiment with these revenue streams. These apps are, in fact, looking to experiment with all kinds of products, from weekly premium plans and fully la carte plans to digital goods like digital flowers. They’re also looking to make their paying customers pay more by providing newer and better dating experiences.\\n\\nIf you’re considering entering this lucrative dating app niche, research your target demographics’ spending behavior. It will help design a monetization model that aligns with your audience’s spending capacity, preferences, and habits.\\n\\n### 6\\\\. Finance apps\\n\\nFinance apps are yet another mobile app type that makes a lot of money. With finance apps, you’re mainly looking at apps for expense tracking, investments, and payments. You also have general financial management apps with features across expense tracking, investments, payments, and more.\\n\\nThe finance app segment is profitable because its users are willing to pay for personal finance management. In its Personal Finance Mobile App Market Outlook [report](https://www.factmr.com/report/personal-finance-mobile-app-market), Fact.MR, a market research provider, surveyed users from 30+ countries like the US, Canada, UK, and Japan and found that about 40% of them are willing to pay for a personal finance mobile app.\\n\\nWhen it comes to monetizing finance apps, app makers use many different approaches. Some finance apps monetize with advertising so they can keep their app free. It’s common to add ads for credit cards, loans, and policies in these apps. Other apps offer a freemium model, offering a limited or ‘lite’ free version with a premium version that’s available via different subscription plans. Some apps also go with the paid mode, catering to just paying users. Another strategy is selling aggregate data to fintech businesses. While this can be a lucrative option, potential risks and ethical considerations are important to factor in. It’s also crucial to ensure that the data is in an aggregate form and isn’t personally identifiable to maintain user trust and stay on the right side of the data protection regulations.\\n\\nThe finance app niche is not just about profitability, but also about innovation. Adding cutting-edge technologies such as AI, machine learning, and blockchain is helping app makers offer personalized experiences, improved returns, and enhanced security to their users.\\n\\n### 7\\\\. Fitness apps\\n\\nValued currently at US$6.86bn, the fitness apps segment is expected to grow at an impressive 9.99% annual growth rate and [hit](https://www.statista.com/outlook/hmo/digital-health/digital-fitness-well-being/health-wellness-coaching/fitness-apps/worldwide) US$10.04bn by 2028. With an average revenue per user at $17.84, the niche caters to users willing to spend on the apps.\\n\\nWhile, again, this niche is super competitive, like the others on the list, one thing about it is that even the newer apps see quite a few downloads. This is probably because users want to try new apps to achieve their fitness goals. For example, if you look for gym log apps, while you’ll see dozens of apps with millions of downloads, you’ll also see apps with thousand or five thousand users.\\n\\nThis indicates that there’s still room for more apps, as users are willing to experiment with newer ones. So, if you can develop a high-value app, you can build a small but loyal user base who’ll also happily pay for it.\\n\\nSpeaking of monetization, fitness apps monetize through various methods. Some offer a free version with ads. Others require a subscription for access to premium features or the premium version that unlocks everything the app has to offer. In-app purchases for personalized coaching are also common monetization strategies. Fitness apps also offer one-time purchases to users so they can unlock features that they want to for a simple one-time fee—for example, to access a new workout regime. This helps users get more value from an app without having to commit to costly subscription plans. And for apps, such in-app purchases means seeing better revenue per user.\\n\\n### 8\\\\. Mental health apps\\n\\nOkay, so mental health apps belong to the fitness apps category. Yet, they stand out because of the market size they address—the mental health apps sub-segment is set to [grow](https://www.factmr.com/report/mental-health-apps-market) at a compound annual growth rate of 15.2%  and reach US$14.72b by 2030.\\n\\nUnder the mental health category, you’re looking at all the apps that help users:\\n\\n- Manage depression, anxiety, and stress\\n- Practice meditation\\n- Prioritize mental wellness\\n\\nOf these, the meditation category has apps like Calm and Headspace, which are market leaders in the mental health app industry. These apps have seen significant success, with an [average ARPU](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1390642/global-meditation-app-market-arpu) of US$40, set to hit US$60 by the end of 2027. Their success can be easily attributed to their user-friendly interfaces, high-quality content, and effective marketing strategies.\\n\\nLike fitness apps, even new mental fitness apps find their share of users, as users are open to trying newer apps for more enriched experiences. For example, mental health apps with AI (for example, with a virtual “friend”) are popular with users. It’s worth noting that many of these apps are relatively new, hinting at the exciting potential for further innovation.\\n\\nIn general, mental health apps monetize via subscription plans, in-app purchases for premium features, partnerships with healthcare providers/brands, sponsored content and advertisements. These apps can also generate revenue through data analytics and insights provided to healthcare organizations or other businesses. Since this is “selling data,” monetizing with this method needs compliance checks and navigating user trust issues, among other things.\\n\\n### 9\\\\. AI-powered apps\\n\\nAs chatGPT became mainstream, a host of app makers cashed in on its popularity to launch AI-powered apps. Just add “AI” to your search phrases and look up any niche, and you’ll see that every niche now has apps that use AI in some form to offer distinguished user experiences. Even the bigger players are adding AI to their apps to offer better app experiences.\\n\\nMany things work for AI apps. AI-powered apps can offer more value. Telling a productivity app’s AI assistant what you want to do and having the assistant create a list of tasks you just need to tick off to get it done translates to a great user experience. AI-powered apps offer better engagement too. AI-powered apps use their users’ data to offer personalized app experiences. And personalized experiences translate to better engagement. Additionally, AI-powered apps can continuously learn and improve over time, delivering even more relevant app expriences to users in the long term. This means you’re looking at better retention.\\n\\nThe monetization model for an AI app will largely depend on the niche and audience segments its targeting.\\n\\n## Wrapping it up…\\n\\nAs you can imagine, mobile apps that make the most money target the most competitive app segments. Unlike niche apps, capturing a share of such saturated markets is challenging. Differentiating your app can be difficult unless it offers unique value.\\n\\nAdditionally, you’ll need to be prepared to invest more in your app’s visibility. Relying solely on [organic discovery methods, like in-store search](https://adapty.io/blog/aso-vs-seo/), won’t likely work. Beyond the discovery stage, too, you’ll also have to invest in experimenting with your in-app products, pricing, and paywalls to encourage more users to upgrade to paid plans or make in-app purchases. Finally, you’ll also need to tap [growth strategies, such as PR](https://adapty.io/blog/pr-campaign-for-mobile-app/) and [holiday marketing](https://adapty.io/blog/growing-mobile-in-app-subscriptions-with-holiday-marketing/), to further boost your user acquisition and revenue campaigns.\\n\\nOverall, making an app profitable in a competitive segment, where the most popular titles capture the majority of profits, is not as easy as breaking into a niche market.

Games dominate in total revenue due to in-app purchases, while non-gaming leaders include streaming, dating, fitness, finance, and productivity apps that monetize recurring user demand.\\n\\n### Do subscription apps earn more than ad-based apps?\\n\\nIn most cases, yes. Subscription apps usually generate higher and more predictable revenue because they rely on recurring payments rather than traffic volume. While ad-based apps can scale with large audiences, subscriptions tend to deliver higher ARPU and long-term lifetime value.\\n\\n### Can free apps make more money than paid apps?\\n\\nYes. Free apps often outperform paid apps because they remove friction at install and monetize later through subscriptions, in-app purchases, or ads. This model allows apps to reach larger audiences and optimize revenue through paywalls and experiments instead of relying on upfront payments.\\n\\n### How long does it take for an app to become profitable?\\n\\nIt usually takes several months to a few years for an app to become profitable, depending on development costs, user acquisition strategy, and retention. Apps that focus early on monetization, paywall optimization, and retention often reach profitability faster.\\n\\n### Which non-gaming apps make the most money?\\n\\nAmong non-gaming apps, streaming, dating, fitness, finance, and education apps generate the highest revenue. These categories perform well because they solve recurring problems or provide ongoing value that users are willing to pay for on a subscription basis.\\n\\n### What factors most influence app revenue?\\n\\nApp revenue is driven by retention, monetization strategy, pricing, user experience, and effective paywalls. Metrics like ARPU, conversion to paid users, and lifetime value play a critical role, while continuous experimentation and personalization help maximize long-term revenue.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Every dollar you invest in user acquisition, every pricing test, and every feature you ship needs data-driven decision-making.\\n\\nBut here’s where most teams go wrong: they track metrics in silos, without looking at a complete picture. Every metric actively influences another. Track them separately, and you miss the compound effects that accelerate or sabotage growth.\\n\\nIn this article, we break down the key metrics for mobile apps, explain how they work together, and provide current benchmarks.\\n\\n## What are the key metric types in mobile app analytics?\\n\\nComplete app analytics requires three interconnected pillars:\\n\\n1. **User acquisition (UA) analytics** – How people discover and install your app\\n2. **Monetization analytics** – How installs translate into revenue\\n3. **Product analytics** – How users behave inside your app\\n\\nEach pillar informs the other two. Let’s break them down one by one.\\n\\n## What’s UA analytics and how it works\\n\\nUser acquisition analytics shows whether your marketing spend is efficient, which channels work, and where traffic quality breaks down.\\n\\n### Core UA metrics\\n\\n| **Name** | **Why track it** | **Avg benchmarks** | **If below the benchmark** |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **CPM (Cost Per Mille — thousand impressions)** | Ad cost efficiency | US: Meta $30–70.<br>Global: $10–20.<br>TikTok usually lower. | Fix targeting, test formats |\\n| **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** | Creative strength and relevance | Weak <0.6%, solid ~0.8–1%, excellent >2%. | Refresh creatives, refine audience |\\n| **CPI (Cost Per Install)** | User acquisition cost | iOS — $3–5, <br>Android — $2–3 | Optimize funnel, cut weak channels |\\n| **Impression-to-Install rate** | Funnel health | 3–4% is good | Improve creatives, fix store page |\\n\\n### Levels of setup\\n\\nThere are three ways to setup UA analytics for your app:\\n\\n- Lightweight — relying on **manual tracking** from ad managers and App Store Console\\n- Partnered — adding to Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs; e.g., Adjust, AppsFlyer) to attribute traffic to channels\\n- Centralized — using tools like Tableau or Looker to centralize all cruical metrics (not only UA) in one place\\n\\n## What’s monetization analytics and how it works\\n\\nMonetization validates whether UA spend makes sense and reveals how your subscription model earns and retains revenue.\\n\\n### Core monetization metrics\\n\\n| **Name** | **Why track it** | **Avg benchmarks** | **If below the benchmark/ drops** |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **MRR** | Core revenue growth | Steady monthly increase | Audit pricing, boost retention |\\n| **CAC** | Cost per paying user | Varies significantly by app and market.In the US: $30–70. | Improve targeting, cut spend |\\n| **ARPU/ARPPU** | User monetization | Varies strongly | Rework paywall, upsell offers |\\n| **ROAS** | Ad spend efficiency | 200–400% is healthy | Pause/optimize campaigns |\\n| **LTV** | Long-term user value | >2× CAC | Fix churn, raise ARPU |\\n| **Refunds rate** | Revenue quality check | 4–7% typical | Review flows, flag fraud |\\n\\n## What’s product analytics and how it works\\n\\nProduct analytics tracks what happens from the first tap onward. For subscription apps, this is where conversion and retention are won or lost.\\n\\n### Core product metrics\\n\\n| **Name** | **Why track it** | **Avg benchmarks** | **If below the benchmark/ drops** |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Retention (D1, D7, D30)** | User stickiness | Varies strongly | Improve onboarding, add hooks |\\n| **DAU/MAU ratio** | Engagement intensity | 20–30% healthy | Add features, boost stickiness |\\n| **Session length/depth** | Usage quality | Varies by category | Simplify UX, add value |\\n| **Funnel conversion** | Revenue path | 30-50% Day 0 conversion into trial | Fix onboarding, test paywalls |\\n| **Feature adoption** | Impacts retention | Key features widely used | Promote features, refine UX |\\n\\n## The unified loop: how metrics types interconnect\\n\\nUA, monetization, and product metrics form a feedback loop. Changes in one ripple through the others. Here’s how:\\n\\n- **Product → Monetization** – Better onboarding, retention, and funnel conversion lift ARPU and LTV.\\n- **Monetization → Product** – Refunds, churn, and paywall test results guide your roadmap. Revenue data reveals which features keep users paying.\\n- **Monetization → Acquisition** – High LTV and ROAS allow you to bid higher and expand reach. Stable cash flow funds aggressive reinvestment.\\n- **Acquisition → Monetization** – Traffic quality determines conversion. Low-intent users from weak targeting raise CAC and lower ARPU/LTV.\\n- **Product → Acquisition** – A sticky product delivers organic growth and reduces CAC. Strong retention amplifies paid campaigns.\\n- **Acquisition → Product** – Poor targeting attracts users who churn fast and send false signals that your product doesn’t work.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTracking metrics in isolation means you optimize locally but miss systemic issues. You might celebrate dropping CPI without realizing those cheaper users have terrible LTV. You might build features while ignoring a broken paywall.\\n\\nThe goal is alignment. When UA brings high-intent users, product delivers fast value, and monetization captures it effectively, growth becomes self-sustaining.\\n\\nFor a deeper look at how analytics can help your app reach $100K MRR, download our full ebook.\\n\\n[Download now](https://adapty.io/ebooks/100k-app-playbook/)\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### What are the main types of mobile app analytics?\\n\\nMobile app analytics are built around three pillars: user acquisition, monetization, and product analytics. Together, they show how users find your app, how you earn revenue, and how people engage with your product.\\n\\n### Why is it important to track app metrics together?\\n\\nEach metric influences the others. Looking at them in isolation hides the real reasons behind growth or decline, while tracking them together reveals how acquisition, engagement, and revenue interact.\\n\\n### What metrics should I track in user acquisition analytics?\\n\\nFocus on CPM, CTR, CPI, and impression-to-install rate. These metrics show how effectively your ads reach and convert users, helping optimize campaigns and cut wasted spend.\\n\\n### How does monetization analytics impact app growth?\\n\\nMonetization analytics connects revenue performance to user behavior and acquisition costs. Tracking metrics like MRR, LTV, CAC, and ROAS helps determine if your pricing and marketing strategies are profitable.\\n\\n### What’s the role of product analytics in subscription apps?\\n\\nProduct analytics reveals how users interact with your app, from onboarding to retention. Monitoring metrics like retention rates, session length, and funnel conversion helps identify friction points and improve user experience.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

The fear of an “imminent” recession got users looking for expenses they could cut out – with many considering their ongoing mobile app subscriptions. Users, too, are seemingly shifting from commiting to subscriptions to favoring ad hoc purchases. This explains [why subscriptions saw a slump in recent times](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/01/02/how-mobile-app-subscription-monetization-will-evolve-in-2023/) –  even if this might only be a temporary trend.\\n\\nAdapting to this new landscape is essential for sustained app growth. And using the right monetization model and strategies is a key part of this mix.\\n\\nIn today’s article, we’ll look at the top app monetization strategies that work for different app monetization models like free, freemium, and paid. We’ll also discuss their key benefits and limitations and a few best practices.\\n\\nHere goes.\\n\\n## Monetizing with in-app purchases\\n\\nIn-app purchases (IAPs) refer to purchases that app users make inside an app to unlock additional features/functions, content, or benefits. In-app purchases are the most effective monetization strategy for mobile apps, accounting for about [48.2% of all mobile app earnings](https://www.businessofapps.com/guide/in-app-purchases).\\n\\nIAPs broadly fall into two categories.\\n\\n#### 1\\\\. One-time in-app purchases\\n\\nOne-time in-app purchases are products that a user pays for just once. Within one-time in-app purchases, you have two types of products:\\n\\n1. Consumables\\n2. Non-Consumables\\n\\n**Consumables** are in-app purchases that users can “consume” and once they do so, the products’ stock expires. For instance, a gaming app user can purchase an extra “life” which gets consumed once a user loses the extra life in the game.\\n\\n**Non-consumables**, on the other hand, are in-app purchases that users can use any number of times. These products don’t expire, so a user can access a non-consumable purchase as many times as they want. For example, a gaming app user can purchase an extra “level”, which is not a consumable product and doesn’t expire.\\n\\nWhen a user makes a non-consumable in-app purchase, it gets tied to their Apple App Store or Google Play store account. And if they reinstall the app, they can restore such in-app purchases. Google Play store automatically restores them, while Apple users can restore them manually.\\n\\nHowever, consumables may not always be restorable.\\n\\n#### 2\\\\. In-app subscriptions\\n\\nSubscriptions are a special kind of an in-app purchase where a user pays a fixed subscription fee every week, month, or quarter (or according to a set subscription cycle) for continued access to the benefits, features, and content that the subscription offers.\\n\\nSubscriptions are an increasingly popular monetization method for app makers, thanks to the predictable revenue they bring. [In fact, a major share (82%!) of the revenue that non-gaming apps make on the app stores actually comes from subscriptions.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1320797/apps-subscription-revenues-share/)\\n\\nIn-app subscriptions, too, come in two forms:\\n\\n1. Auto-renewable subscriptions\\n2. Non-renewable subscriptions\\n\\nAuto-renewable subscriptions are subscriptions that renew automatically. Here, you ask your users – “subscribers” – to agree to your billing terms, which include charging them an automatic payment in line with the subscription plan they subscribe to. Renewal subscription payments are charged automatically and don’t need any user authentication.\\n\\nNon-renewable subscriptions – which the Google Play store refers to as “prepaid” subscriptions – are subscriptions that don’t automatically get renewed. For example, a health app can launch a non-renewable one-month subscription plan that unlocks the entire app for a user for a month. But the plan doesn’t auto-renew after the subscription period ends. You could also loosely call a lifetime subscription plan a non-renewable one.\\n\\nLet’s now see how apps actually monetize with in-app purchases.\\n\\n[![demo page 4 6](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/demo-page-4-6-1024x286.png)](https://adapty.io/schedule-demo/)\\n\\n### Three models of monetizing a mobile app with in-app purchases\\n\\n**Requiring users to make a payment upfront – the “paid-to-download” – app monetization model**\\n\\nIn this paid app monetization model, your users need to pay to download your app. These sales technically happen on the app store – and not inside your app. About [3.1% of apps in the Google Play store and 5.8% apps in the App Store](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263797/number-of-applications-for-mobile-phones/) follow the paid-to-download monetization strategy.\\n\\nHere’s a wallpaper app using the paid-to-download model:\\n\\n![a paid to download mobile app](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/a-paid-to-download-mobile-app-498x1024.png)\\n\\nSome app makers even launch two versions of their apps when using this model. They offer a free or a freemium version (which is monetized via ads or in-app purchases) and a paid version that’s only available after making a payment upfront. The free version here helps build a user base for the paid version. ABBYY, an app business in the productivity niche, does this well. It offers both free and paid versions of its PDF reader app. ABBYY also offers a one-time purchase option (via its lifetime plan) and monthly and annual plans to its users in the free version and prompts them to migrate over to the paid app.\\n\\n![FineReade Mobile Scanner app freemium app](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FineReade-Mobile-Scanner-app-freemium-app-502x1024.png)FineReader: Mobile Scanner app – A freemium app.\\n\\n![paywall in a free app sending users to the paid app](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/paywall-in-a-free-app-sending-users-to-the-paid-app-503x1024.png)The free version’s paywall prompting users to buy the premium version!\\n\\n![FineReader Pro app](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FineReader-Pro-app-498x1024.png)FineReader Pro: PDF Scanner app – You must pay to download.\\n\\nUser acquisition can be a problem with the paid download app model as users can be reluctant to download paid apps, especially paid apps that don’t offer trials. However, this can improve if you offer a free trial, as you can make the decision relatively risk-free for your users. Alternatively, you can offer a “lite” or free version like ABBY does.\\n\\n**Requiring users to pay payments for accessing premium features, benefits, or content**\\n\\nWe’re talking about the standard freemium mobile app monetization model here. With this model, you give your users a basic version of your mobile app for free while making premium features, functionalities, and content available only in the “premium” version.\\n\\nThe premium version can either be available as a one-time purchase (as we saw above with the app from ABBY) or via subscriptions.\\n\\nminimalist, a freemium productivity mobile app, gives its users three subscription plans to move over to its more powerful premium version. The app is free to download, but to use it, you need to sign up for a paid subscription at the end of the onbaoarding stage. The subscription plans, however, come with free trials.\\n\\n![minimalist mobile app monetization](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/minimalist-mobile-app-monetization-472x1024.png)\\n\\nWhile in-app purchases drive a freemium app’s revenue, it can also use a hybrid approach to monetization and use everything from in-app purchases, ads, and affiliate marketing. This way, an app can monetize even its free user base while drawing predictable growth from selling its premium products/subscription plans.\\n\\nFor some users, even ad-free app experiences are worth paying for. So an app’s pro version can simply be free of ads. Once users make an in-app purchase, they can avoid the app’s ads. By the way, if you’re currently offering a freemium app, check out the top ten reasons that you can use to [get paid users/subscribers for it](https://adapty.io/blog/top-reasons-mobile-app-users-go-from-freemium-to-premium/).\\n\\n**Requiring users to pay a “top-up” on top of their paid plan – the “paymium” mobile app monetization model**\\n\\nYou can also explore the paymium (or the “paid + premium”) app monetization strategy.\\n\\nIn the paymium model, users must pay upfront to download/access your app. However, they’ll also be presented with additional features or content that they can purchase within the app. The key difference between paymium and freemium models is that for a paymium app, users first need to pay to download/access the app and then purchase additional add-ons, while a freemium app is available to download for free and users only pay to unlock its premium features.\\n\\nFor instance, if you offer a subscription-based mental health app, you can offer an add-on journaling feature. This helps you improve your user lifetime value.\\n\\n#### Adding different types of in-app purchases to an app’s monetization mix\\n\\nMany app subscribers aren’t ready to commit to subscriptions.\\n\\nHowever, they don’t mind paying a small one-time for a certain feature they see themselves using.\\n\\nIn such cases, the best monetization model is to offer a mix of subscriptions and one-off purchases. Take the Lensa app, for instance. Lensa offers a great mix of one-time and subscription in-app purchases. Also, since it’s a freemium app, you get a lite free version as well:\\n\\n![lensa mobile app monetization subscription](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lensa-mobile-app-monetization-subscription-472x1024.png)Lensa’s subscription in-app purchase:\\n\\n![lensa mobile app monetization one time purchase](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lensa-mobile-app-monetization-one-time-purchase-503x1024.png)Lensa’s one-off in-app purchases:\\n\\n![lensa mobile app monetization freemium model](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lensa-mobile-app-monetization-freemium-model-486x1024.png)Lensa’s freemium app monetization model:\\n\\n## How to add in-app purchases to Android and iOS apps (Meet Adapty.io)\\n\\nIf you want to add in-app purchases (one-time products or subscriptions) to your app’s monetization mix, you need to add a payments infrastructure to it to handle all the payment logistics.\\n\\nEnter [Adapty](https://adapty.io/).\\n\\nAdapty offers a ready-to-deploy payment infrastructure that lets you sell in-app purchases in your Android and iOS apps.

As of now, [97% of apps on the Google Play store are available for free](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266211/distribution-of-free-and-paid-android-apps/#:~:text=As%20of%20November%202022%2C%20around,apps%20in%20the%20examined%20period.), whereas [94.2 percent of all iOS applications](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1020996/distribution-of-free-and-paid-ios-apps/) are free to download. Note that the free-to-download apps can be freemium too (in which case they’ll offer in-app purchases).\\n\\nBut free apps are different from freemium apps.\\n\\nIn the free app monetization model, your users don’t have to pay anything to download or use your app. There’s no “premium” version here. Your users get your full app for free. With this model, you generate revenue by tapping other sources. Lets go over the top ones.\\n\\n### Monetizing with in-app advertising\\n\\nGiven that mobile app ads perform better than general mobile ads, businesses are looking to invest a good part of their mobile advertising budgets into them. That explains why in-app advertising is one of the leading mobile app monetization methods. Global in-app advertising spend is expected to hit [USD 226.4 billion in 2025](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/in-app-advertising-market). It has also [more than doubled from 2016 to 2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241245/gross-app-spending/).\\n\\nWith this monetization method, you join a mobile app ad network like InMobi as a “publisher.” Next, you give the relevant permissions to the ad network, like the ones it needs to know your users’ location (so it can deliver targeted ad campaigns). Finally, you tell the ad network about your ad units. Once you put up your ad unit inventory, the ad network matches you with advertisers whose ads get served inside your apps. Ad units are essentially the types of ad formats (banners, video ads, interstitials, etc.) that your app supports. Different ad formats perform differently across different industries. If you see yourself using ads to monetize your app, design your app’s flow and UI accordingly so that ads don’t get in the way of a good user experience.\\n\\nDepending on the in-app advertising payment model you choose, you can get paid:\\n\\n- Every time you deliver a 1000 ad impressions – the cost-per-mile model. If you’re into video ads, then you’d monetize using the cost-per-view model.\\n- Every time an app user clicks an ad – the cost-per-click model.\\n- Every time an app user makes an install – the cost-per-install model.\\n\\nIn addition to these standard payment models, there’s also a “cost-per-action” in-app advertising model where you’re paid each time a user completes a certain action that the advertising brand wants. For example, an advertiser might only want your app user to click through to their website or app and complete a specific action, like signing up.\\n\\nEach payment model has its own benefits and challenges. The cost-per-mile model works pretty straightforwardly. You only need a huge app user base, and the ad income will follow. However, the cost-per-action model that pays the best depends a lot on the quality of your audience.\\n\\nHere’s INKHUNT, a free tattoo app that uses ads for monetization:\\n\\n![mobile app monetization INKHUNT a free tattoo app](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-INKHUNT-a-free-tattoo-app-495x1024.png)See the “Contains ads” label on the app listing.\\n\\n![mobile app monetization INKHUNT a free tattoo app using ads](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-INKHUNT-a-free-tattoo-app-using-ads-500x1024.png)Here’s the app prompting a user to view a video ad to unlock its content.\\n\\n![mobile app monetization INKHUNT a free tattoo app monetizing with ads](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-INKHUNT-a-free-tattoo-app-monetizing-with-ads-500x1024.png)A video ad running in the app.\\n\\nMany ad networks even have calculators that tell you your potential earnings with in-app advertising. [Here’s](https://admob.google.com/home/) Google’s advertising revenue calculator for its AdMob ad network.\\n\\n### Monetizing with data licensing\\n\\nData licensing means selling your app user data – for example, insights on your users’ in-app actions – to businesses or data providers.\\n\\nNaturally, to use this monetization method, you need to mention that you engage in such data sharing. You need to mention this everywhere, from your app listing to your usage terms and privacy policy. You’d also need approval from the app store(s) and from your users.\\n\\nSince this mobile app monetization relies on data sharing, things can get complicated here. In India, food delivery apps recently came under the scanner for such data sharing and were directed to [seek users’ explicit permission when engaging in such data practices.](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/zomato-swiggy-directed-to-make-data-sharing-call-the-user-s-prerogative-122061301028_1.html) One such app, Swiggy, maintained that while it didn’t share customer names and contact information in view of data privacy, it did share “information related to food orders, and insights on demand and selection is shared with restaurant partners.” Do you know how valuable this information can be? A restaurant chain can use it to determine if it can open an outlet in a specific location.\\n\\nHere’s zooming in on Swiggy’s Android app listing’s data safety section. You can see its data-sharing practices here:\\n\\n![mobile app monetization data sharing](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-data-sharing-499x1024.png)\\n\\nUsers, too, care more now about protecting their digital data than ever before. The shifting digital privacy lines impact your income potential with this monetization strategy, as you can be seen to be “harvesting” data for money.\\n\\n### Monetizing with affiliate marketing\\n\\nHere, you’re essentially an affiliate, and your app is your monetization channel. With this model, you make revenue – or affiliate income – by making product recommendations inside your app and earning commissions on product sales.\\n\\nTo make money with affiliate marketing inside your app, you need to sign up for affiliate marketing programs. Depending on your app niche, you can either sign up for a very generic affiliate program like Amazon Associates or with niche affiliate programs in the healthcare, travel, or crypto niches. When you link to products or services from these programs from within your app, you use your affiliate ID with your links. That’s it! Each time your app user makes a purchase using your affiliate link, you earn a commission.\\n\\nHere’s Skin Bliss, an app in the skincare niche that monetizes really well with affiliate commissions:\\n\\n![Skin Bliss mobile app monetization](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Skin-Bliss-mobile-app-monetization-479x1024.png)\\n\\n![affilaite mobile app monetization 1](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/affilaite-mobile-app-monetization-1-502x1024.png)\\n\\n![mobile app monetization with affiliate marketing](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-with-affiliate-marketing-499x1024.png)\\n\\nYou can also promote other apps inside your app as an affiliate. Both the Google Play store and the App Store run affiliate programs for promoting apps.\\n\\n### Monetizing with sponsorships\\n\\nYet another way to make money from a free app is via sponsorships. Here, you find businesses to sponsor your app, and in exchange, you promote the business via your app. You can also tie up with a single business and work exclusively with them.\\n\\nFor example, if you’re a beauty influencer and have an app, you can get a brand that you promote to become your sponsor. You could personalize your content to offer makeup tutorials using just your sponsor’s products. You could design a morning or night skin care regime inside your app using your sponsor’s products exclusively. You’d also use your app’s ad units to show your sponsor’s product range and offers.\\n\\nYou get the drift.\\n\\nObviously, to use this monetization method, you’d need to be able to convince a brand that you’ve quality app users and that your app’s reach can mean business for the brand.\\n\\n### Monetizing with donations\\n\\nWhen you’ve built an app and managed to connect with your niche target audience, one way you can monetize it is via donations.\\n\\nHere, your app users are “patrons” that support your app. And it’s with the support of these patrons that you make your full app available to everyone for free.\\n\\nTo make the most of this monetization method, you can suggest recommendations around how much a user can donate to make a meaningful contribution. For example, you can tell your users how much money you need to cover your app’s monthly maintenance and what contribution can make a difference to it. You can set up either one-time or recurring donations.\\n\\nAs you can tell, this monetization method isn’t for everyone (as most app users don’t intend to pay!). This model can work well when your app helps with something people really care about.\\n\\nTake this app, for instance, dealing with mental wellness (a niche many people deeply care for). With 100k downloads, this app is supported only via donations:\\n\\n![mobile app monetization via donations](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-via-donations-472x1024.png)\\n\\n### Monetizing with crowdfunding\\n\\nWhile we’re at it, let’s talk about crowdfunding as well. Crowdfunding is a great way to generate money to support a new app. You’ll be surprised to learn that many profitable apps actually tapped crowdfunding to raise funds.\\n\\nIn addition to generic crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter, you also have app-specific crowdfunding platforms like AppStori, AppBackr, and AppsFunder for generating money for your app.\\n\\nWhen you use this monetization method, you need to come up with ways to reward your “backers.”\\n\\nHere’s Seedtime, a gardening app that generated $341,796 for its initial development via crowdfunding:\\n\\n![mobile app monetization crowdfunding](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-crowdfunding-1024x465.png)\\n\\n### Monetizing with physical goods and services\\n\\nThis app monetization method is for businesses with products or services that they want to market and sell through their own app. Such apps are by established retail or service companies that want to reach more users via their brand apps. In such cases, the app is only a business channel for driving sales.\\n\\nHere’s Tanishq, a jewelry retailer’s app: (Notice that the listing is also marked as “Retailer”)\\n\\n![mobile app monetization with physical goods](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-with-physical-goods-498x1024.png)\\n\\nAs you can tell, you can launch a free app using this monetization model only when you have a product or service. In fact, businesses run “ [app install](https://adapty.io/glossary/app-installs-and-uninstalls/)” ad campaigns inside other mobile apps to promote their app downloads. The global app install ad spend — the money brands put into campaigns to get app installs and build their app user base — is expected to reach [$118 billion USD by 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/986536/mobile-app-install-advertising-spending-global/).\\n\\n### Monetizing using a hybrid app monetization model\\n\\nMost free mobile apps will use a host of the monetization methods that we just saw, as relying on a single one can make even sustainability difficult. A free app typically uses a mix of these monetization strategies. So you’ll find a free app serving ads, marketing affiliate products, and even licensing data.\\n\\nLet’s now see how in-app purchases in freemium apps actually work.\\n\\n## A few best practices to keep in mind when monetizing a mobile app\\n\\n### Experiment with your Google Play and App Store app listings\\n\\nBoth the app stores allow you to run A/B tests on your app listings, so run experiments to find out what messaging or graphics resonate the best with your users. You also need to ensure your [app store listings get more visibility and traffic.](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-improve-app-visibility-using-promoted-in-app-purchases/) This is especially useful for you if you’ve a paid-to-download app – or simply, a paid app – as you need to make a sale on your app store listing itself.\\n\\n### Do extensive testing on your paywalls\\n\\nPricing lies at the heart of your app monetization. And getting it right is a challenge. The best way to find out is to test. So try offering different price points to your users to see which pricing works the best.\\n\\nWith Adapty, you can run experiments on your paywalls and find messaging, design, or price points that work the best for you. If you offer a subscription app, you can test different subscription plans. And even offers.\\n\\nWhen ABBY experimented with its offers and subscription plans on its freemium app, it saw a 58.5% increase in its annual subscription revenue. Read the full case study [here.](https://adapty.io/case-studies/abbyy/)\\n\\n![mobile app monetization paywall ab tests](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobile-app-monetization-paywall-ab-tests-1024x591.png)\\n\\nCheck out our [guide on mobile app paywall experimentation to learn everything that’s there to running winning paywall experiments.](https://adapty.io/blog/mobile-app-paywall-ab-testing/)\\n\\n### Offer trials when possible and use a special trial offer paywall\\n\\nIf possible, always add a trial to your premium version, as it can make upgrades feel risk-free. Also, when offering a free trial, use a specialized paywall like the timeline paywall to explain how the trial works. Read up on our guide on the [different types of mobile app paywalls for more on this](https://adapty.io/blog/the-10-types-of-mobile-app-paywalls/).\\n\\nAnalytics is another area to focus on while doing all of this. It’s essential to keep a handle on the install-to-paid and trial-to-paid metrics. With Adapty, you get built-in analytics answering all these questions for you.\\n\\n## Wrapping it up…\\n\\nSo there you have them! The top mobile app monetization strategies. However, to make the most of them, you need to be intentional about how you build your app. For example, if you want to use affiliate marketing, think like Skin Bliss. The app offers excellent value with a great UI and user flow. Its monetization method fits seamlessly into the app and helps the app make money without compromising on the user experience. That’s the idea!\\n\\nAlso, don’t forget, in-app purchases are a real winner. When you’re ready to monetize your app with these, consider adding a solution like Adapty to your app stack. With Adapty, you can add all kinds of in-app purchases inside your Android or iOS apps. You can also use it to run paywall A/B tests, personalization experiments, and edit your paywalls to make them more relevant on the fly without needing to go through new version release cycles.\\n\\n[Sign up for Adapty for free or get in touch for a demo!](https://adapty.io/schedule-demo/)\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

But how do they actually monetize attention?\\n\\n![Borisikbanner](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/09/borisikbanner-1024x330.webp)\\n\\nIn this issue, we break down four real paywalls with the help of **[Max Borisik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximborisik/)**, Product Manager for Adapty’s Paywall Builder.

Free trials and clear cancellation policies help; overloaded paywalls can push people away.\\n\\nCurious how other apps monetize?

No, nobody has!\\n\\nSubmitting screenshots is a requirement when listing your app on the App Store. And the reason they’re compulsory is that screenshots are one of the main determinants when it comes to convincing users to download and use your app. Plus with [over 2 million apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-stores/#:~:text=downloaded%20individual%20apps.-,Apps%20%26%20Games%20in%20the%20Apple%20App%20Store,21.4%25%20on%20the%20previous%20year.) out there, it’s tough competition, and you have to stand out one way or the other.\\n\\nSo in this blog, we’re walking you through the App Store screenshot sizes and requirements in 2026. Over time, these requirements have changed, and it’s essential that you have the latest information about app store screenshot requirements!\\n\\n## App Store screenshot sizes and dimensions for iOS Devices\\n\\nLuckily for app developers and marketers, Apple’s guidelines regarding app screenshots are fairly simple and to the point. Regardless of your device, you’re limited to only 10 screenshots per localized listing. So, you can have 10 different screenshots for a Spanish audience as compared to 10 screenshots for your English-speaking market!\\n\\nIt’s not required that you use up all 10 screenshots since each app is different, but you should use as many slots as possible to convince potential users to download and use your app.\\n\\nAnother rule by Apple is that you’re only allowed to use images or videos captured from within your app. That means you can’t submit screenshots taken from external cameras or images that don’t actually appear within your app. This prevents any situations around clickbait, which serves users positively!\\n\\nLast but not least, Apple’s screenshot also must be in one of the three formats:\\n\\n- PNG,\\n- JPEG, or\\n- Video format.\\n\\nNow, let’s talk specifics about different Apple devices and their screenshot requirements:\\n\\n### iPhone screenshot sizes and requirements\\n\\nApple officially reached a billion-user mark in 2020 and a large chunk of those users are iPhone owners. This makes the iPhone one of the largest demographics any app developer can target in the App Store. Here are the iPhone screenshot sizes and requirements:\\n\\n| Device group | Logical resolution (px) | Screenshot size (px) | Aspect ratio | Notes |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| iPhone Pro Max (6.7″) | 1290 × 2796 | 1290 × 2796 | 19.5:9 | Covers Pro Max devices |\\n| iPhone Plus / Pro (6.5–6.7″) | 1242 × 2688 | 1242 × 2688 | 19.5:9 | Optional, legacy support |\\n| iPhone Pro / Standard (6.1″) | 1179 × 2556 | 1179 × 2556 | 19.5:9 | Most common size |\\n| iPhone Mini / SE (5.4″) | 1080 × 2340 | 1080 × 2340 | 19.5:9 | Low priority |\\n\\n### iPad screenshot sizes and guidelines\\n\\nMany apps in the App Store are targeted towards iPads, especially when it comes to productivity or entertainment apps. If that’s where your target audience resides, you’ll want to consider the following resolutions and guidelines for your app screenshots:\\n\\n| iPad model group | Resolution (px) | Orientation | Notes |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| iPad Pro 12.9″ | 2048 × 2732 | Portrait | Largest iPad format |\\n| iPad Pro 11″ | 1668 × 2388 | Portrait | Covers most Pro models |\\n| iPad / iPad Air | 1640 × 2360 | Portrait | Safe universal option |\\n| iPad Mini | 1488 × 2266 | Portrait | Optional |\\n\\n### Apple Watch screenshot sizes and dimensions\\n\\nRecently, there have been many apps that target Apple Watch users, especially when we look into the fitness niche. After all, the rise of smart health gadgets is on the rise and Apple Watch is a strong contender in that niche. Here are the screenshot sizes you’ll want to adhere to if you’re focusing on the Apple Watch:\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Device** | **Screenshot Size** |\\n| Apple Watch Ultra | 410 x 502 px |\\n| Apple Watch Series 8, Series 7 | 396 x 484 px |\\n| Apple Watch Series 6, Series 5, Series 4, and SE | 368 x 448 px |\\n| Apple Watch Series 3 | 312 x 390 px |\\n\\n### Mac screenshot sizes and requirements\\n\\nLast but not least, the Mac is one of the prevalent devices Apple offers and hence, it has its own range of screenshot sizes and requirements you must fulfill. It’s important to remember that the rules mentioned earlier in this blog still apply to all devices:\\n\\n| Use case | Recommended resolution (px) | Notes |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Minimum accepted size | 1280 × 800 | Apple’s minimum requirement |\\n| Standard Retina Mac | 2560 × 1600 | Best balance of quality and weight |\\n| Large display / Pro apps | 2880 × 1800 | Suitable for complex UIs |\\n| High-end showcase | 3072 × 1920 | Optional, use only if UI benefits |\\n\\n### Minimum screenshot sets for App Store submission\\n\\n| Platform | Required sizes | Optional |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| iPhone | 6.7″ + 6.1″ | 5.4″ |\\n| iPad | 12.9″ | 11″ |\\n| Apple Watch | Per model | — |\\n\\n## App preview video sizes and guidelines\\n\\nApp Preview videos, allowed by Apple for app listings, aim to enhance user engagement. Apple provides clear guidelines regarding the format and specifications for these videos.\\n\\nDevelopers can submit videos in either H.264 or ProRes 422 (HQ only) formats, aligning with resolution recommendations similar to those for screenshots. The duration of the video should be between 15 and 25 seconds, and its file size should not exceed 500 MB.\\n\\nEach app listing can accommodate up to three videos, which can be either in portrait or landscape orientation. Depending on the video’s orientation, it may replace the first screenshot on the product page or appear in the app store’s search results.\\n\\nFor instance, portrait-oriented videos occupy the first position on the app listing, while landscape-oriented ones are visible in search results.\\n\\nApple imposes restrictions on app preview videos, requiring them to be on-screen recordings. This means developers cannot submit third-party captured or digitally rendered promotional videos to the App Store. Additionally, it’s essential to avoid including copyrighted materials in the submissions to comply with Apple’s policies.\\n\\n## App screenshot colors and backgrounds\\n\\nStrategic use of colors and backgrounds in-app screenshots can profoundly influence user perception and engagement while enhancing the overall visual appeal of app listings. Colors play a pivotal role in conveying emotions and messages, allowing developers to evoke specific feelings or associations with their apps.\\n\\nFor instance, vibrant colors may create a sense of excitement or urgency, while softer hues can evoke calmness or trust. By aligning colors with the app’s branding and target audience preferences, app developers can strengthen brand identity and establish a connection with users.\\n\\nMoreover, contrasting colors between the app interface and the background can effectively highlight key features, drawing users’ attention to specific elements and enhancing usability.\\n\\nBackgrounds also play a crucial role in setting the tone and context for app screenshots. Whether using solid colors, gradients, or subtle textures, backgrounds provide visual context and contribute to the overall aesthetic appeal of the screenshots.\\n\\nConsistency in color schemes and backgrounds across screenshots reinforces brand coherence and professionalism, contributing to a cohesive and polished app listing.\\n\\n## App Store screenshots styles\\n\\n### Classic\\n\\nPerhaps one of the simplest styles, the Classic screenshots are in-app screenshots without any editing or redesigns. It comes off as easy and quick to create while clearly showing exactly what your app looks like, but they’re not as engaging as other screenshot styles. So if you’re newly launching an app, classic screenshots might not be the best approach.\\n\\n![Lt0 frzonAlCnlUV9X aj2Ov4PBRjoy3B1V6s9we3LP9FhAXJp2pCK 04730VqpCimLeWIBP8FzKGXVX5dh1fZLoP](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Lt0-frzonAlCnlUV9X-aj2Ov4PBRjoy3B1V6s9we3LP9FhAXJp2pCK_04730VqpCimLeWIBP8FzKGXVX5dh1fZLoP-IXfJUZWdWJchkmkc5kqtBfkuxWKRwwDXbrv9G8TzB7yzjgVF2xROajcuUi0Dk)\\n\\n### Solid\\n\\nAs the name suggests, the Solid style employs bold, uniform backgrounds to make content stand out. This style is particularly effective when you want to create a strong visual impact and draw attention to specific features of your app. Solid backgrounds provide consistency across screenshots, reinforcing brand identity and making your content pop.\\n\\n![0yJGmohBabhARjhL7Ve88azGSlzMulJk Gu2IexXxqFI7oQFobPHGHqp5VvIFxmnPX1MDupyOgkm9jeicgSv5zpcNpW5l58IrQNs0Sp4hWIFO7mt251ero0QYFlEo0PW1QIOC vWavKvjK 8Fg6JfHc](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0yJGmohBabhARjhL7Ve88azGSlzMulJk-Gu2IexXxqFI7oQFobPHGHqp5VvIFxmnPX1MDupyOgkm9jeicgSv5zpcNpW5l58IrQNs0Sp4hWIFO7mt251ero0QYFlEo0PW1QIOC_vWavKvjK-8Fg6JfHc)\\n\\n### Blurred\\n\\nThe “Blurred” style artistically blurs backgrounds to focus attention on specific app features or content. Achieving a balance between aesthetics and clarity is crucial in this style, ensuring that the blur effect enhances the overall user experience without obscuring important details.\\n\\nBlurred backgrounds create a visually appealing backdrop that highlights the key elements of your app.\\n\\n![blurred](https://adapty.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blurred.png)\\n\\n### Connected\\n\\nThe Connected style features screenshots that form a continuous visual story or theme when viewed in sequence. This style enhances user engagement and understanding by guiding users through the app experience step by step.\\n\\nTo create a cohesive narrative across screenshots, ensure that there is a logical flow between them and that they collectively communicate the app’s functionalities and benefits. For apps with complex features or functionalities, this style may not be the perfect fit and can make it difficult to capture features linearly.\\n\\n![aZLSUiqehggtBVzxzCNVApFlCV7kK 6sAObb3kQvEHdu WBYnXleMFkiVjMIndQcwc mYQT jkQnTwN3tAyEHLIU1FjDQ65mbTAakR8ypZpK3nOjVWAt5fvXRXoG 7LclsgEc 66GdUWHC9Ldjtbrs8](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/aZLSUiqehggtBVzxzCNVApFlCV7kK-6sAObb3kQvEHdu_WBYnXleMFkiVjMIndQcwc-mYQT_jkQnTwN3tAyEHLIU1FjDQ65mbTAakR8ypZpK3nOjVWAt5fvXRXoG_7LclsgEc-66GdUWHC9Ldjtbrs8)\\n\\n### Tutorials\\n\\nThe Tutorial style uses screenshots to guide users through app functionalities or features step by step.

In this style, you select images that resonate with the target audience and depict the app being used in authentic contexts.\\n\\nApp developers can use this style to create a personal and emotional connection with users and demonstrate the practical benefits of using your app. However, this often means that you need access to professional photography or high-quality stock images, which can be costly.\\n\\n![fGF9WKiWU1jWk2ErIgS8VF7luMeAH0CiQSkN7YMJrwYaqbBW70Ow4yEePXLI48c3c6NiJwc7E HC1FhJJ1Zn1c VmZ nmrajgUSupyudHWJUPeoUi5wdy6vz1TwbfH4CpYpTzsCzsSagF53P0jrWff8](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fGF9WKiWU1jWk2ErIgS8VF7luMeAH0CiQSkN7YMJrwYaqbBW70Ow4yEePXLI48c3c6NiJwc7E_HC1FhJJ1Zn1c-VmZ-nmrajgUSupyudHWJUPeoUi5wdy6vz1TwbfH4CpYpTzsCzsSagF53P0jrWff8)\\n\\n### Combinations\\n\\nNow, if you think you have to stick to one of these styles frigidly, think again!

The reason is that screenshots influence your app store optimization strategy!\\n\\nApp Store screenshots play a significant role in App Store Optimization (ASO), affecting visibility, user engagement, and download rates. Let’s talk about how each of these is affected by screenshot sizes and styles.\\n\\nWhen it comes to visibility, screenshots are often the first visual element users see when browsing the App Store. Compelling screenshots can grab users’ attention and entice them to learn more about the app.\\n\\nFurthermore, App Store algorithms may consider user engagement metrics, such as click-through rates on screenshots, when determining search rankings. Engaging screenshots can improve visibility by encouraging users to click on the app listing.\\n\\nThis brings us to user engagement, an important aspect to consider if you want people to hit download. Screenshots provide an opportunity to showcase the app’s features and benefits visually. Clear and captivating screenshots can effectively communicate the app’s value proposition to users. Engaging screenshots can lead to higher conversion rates, as users are more likely to download an app that they perceive as valuable and useful based on the screenshots.\\n\\nLastly, well-designed screenshots can influence users’ decision-making process, convincing them to download the app. Users may be more inclined to download an app if they believe it offers the features and functionality they need, as demonstrated in the screenshots.\\n\\nPlus, they’re less likely to uninstall an app that stands true to its screenshot representation!\\n\\nNow since app screenshots are crucial to your ASO, it’s also important that you conduct A/B testing and implement user feedback in your screenshots to further optimize your app in the App Store. With A/B testing, you can identify which designs resonate best with your target audience (and which don’t)!\\n\\nIteratively refining screenshot designs based on user feedback can lead to higher user satisfaction and increased download rates over time.\\n\\nI’ve been mentioning a lot of important metrics that you should keep in mind while adjusting your screenshot strategy, and you might be wondering, “How am I supposed to calculate or figure those numbers out? What are good numbers in these KPIs?”\\n\\nFor that, you can [rely on Adapty to answer all your data questions](https://adapty.io/cohorts/) with essential metrics, and monetization effectiveness as well as analyze how your core metrics change over time. Our Analytics and Paywall Builder can supercharge your monetization strategy and help you make informed data-driven decisions along the way!\\n\\n## Best practices for the App Store screenshots\\n\\nCreating effective App Store screenshots is crucial for showcasing your app’s unique selling points and enticing users to download it. And to make things better, I’ve got 4 tips for you to up your app screenshot game:\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Highlight key features clearly\\n\\nClearly identify and prioritize the most important features of your app in your screenshots. Use visually striking elements such as arrows, callout boxes, or overlays to draw attention to these features. Emphasize how these features solve user pain points or enhance their experience, getting to the point before the user loses interest.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Test different variations\\n\\nExperiment with different screenshot variations to see which ones perform best with your target audience. Test variations in layout, design elements, and messaging to identify which combinations result in the highest conversion rates. Use A/B testing tools to gather data and make informed decisions about which screenshots to use.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Localize for different markets\\n\\nTailor your screenshots to resonate with users in different regions by [localizing them for specific languages and cultural preferences](https://adapty.io/blog/mobile-app-localization/). Consider using localized text, images, or symbols that are relevant to your target audience in each market. Localizing your screenshots can help you connect with users on a deeper level and increase engagement and conversions.\\n\\nFor instance, [FiftyThree localized their Paper app for the Chinese market](https://splitmetrics.com/cases/fiftythree-localizes-screenshots-for-app-store/) and gained a 33% conversion increase!\\n\\n![jsyM92ERsL9LbDQrelPbIWBN hfTBHgh7NUsP94Kb1Ml2snT1nyJJuhG41BDO DZFIlZOP1UqzAQIEvBWRGHWd 4Gcow61oPTCEMpi2mHJgqucU2KQ6x ItF](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jsyM92ERsL9LbDQrelPbIWBN-hfTBHgh7NUsP94Kb1Ml2snT1nyJJuhG41BDO-DZFIlZOP1UqzAQIEvBWRGHWd_4Gcow61oPTCEMpi2mHJgqucU2KQ6x_ItF-yxxs39U8EmHnILBlANNCyoRtSIWyN0)\\n\\n### 4\\\\. Optimize for mobile viewing\\n\\nSince most users will view your screenshots on mobile devices, ensure that they are optimized for smaller screens. Use large, legible text and avoid overcrowding the screen with too many elements. Test your screenshots on various devices to ensure they look good and are easy to read on different screen sizes.\\n\\n## Common App Store screenshot mistakes\\n\\n| Mistake | Why it’s a problem |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Using outdated resolutions | Screenshots rejected or blurred |\\n| Uploading too many sizes | Extra work without ASO benefit |\\n| Mixing aspect ratios | Inconsistent App Store preview |\\n| Ignoring safe areas | UI elements cropped |\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nApp screenshots can really make or break your app when it comes to the cut-throat competition within the Apple App Store. With engaging and accurate screenshots by your side, your app can pick up a higher download rate and gain positive ratings and reviews. But to put in these screenshots, you have to adhere to Apple’s guidelines.\\n\\nIn this blog, we tackled all the guidelines you need to keep in mind when capturing and uploading your screenshots for your app. Not only do they improve your app preview and app listings, but they can also impact your app store optimization!\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### What is the minimum screenshot resolution for App Store apps?\\n\\nThe minimum resolution depends on the platform. For iPhone and iPad, screenshots must match the native resolution of the selected device size. For Mac apps, the minimum accepted screenshot resolution is 1280 × 800 pixels.\\n\\n### Do I need screenshots for every device size?\\n\\nNo. You do not need screenshots for every individual device. Apple allows one set of screenshots to cover a group of devices with the same screen size class. In practice, uploading screenshots for the most common sizes is enough to cover the majority of users.\\n\\n### Which iPhone screenshot size covers most devices?The 6.1-inch iPhone screenshot size (1179 × 2556 px) covers the majority of modern iPhone models. It is currently the most common screen size and is often sufficient as a primary iPhone screenshot set.\\n\\nThe 6.1-inch iPhone screenshot size (1179 × 2556 px) covers the majority of modern iPhone models. It is currently the most common screen size and is often sufficient as a primary iPhone screenshot set.\\n\\n### What screenshot size covers the majority of Apple devices?\\n\\nA combination of 6.1-inch iPhone screenshots and 12.9-inch iPad screenshots covers most Apple mobile devices. This approach minimizes workload while ensuring broad compatibility across iPhone and iPad models.\\n\\n### Can screenshots affect App Store ranking?\\n\\nScreenshots do not directly influence App Store rankings, but they strongly impact conversion rate. Higher conversion leads to more downloads, which can indirectly improve visibility and ranking in App Store search results.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses give you insights that can help you:\\n\\n1. Set realistic goals for your mobile app.\\n2. Plan sales and marketing strategies.\\n3. Adjust them as needed for sustainable growth.\\n\\nSo let’s understand TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses, how they apply to mobile apps, and how to calculate them!\\n\\nHere goes.\\n\\n## What is TAM?\\n\\nTAM – Total Addressable Market or Total Available Market – represents the market or “opportunity” available for your mobile app. For example, if you’re looking to launch a meditation mobile app, then your target market comprises people going through all kinds of conditions like stress, anxiety, and depression. You’re also looking at people looking for better mental health or mood. Finally, you’ll also cater to users specifically seeking help with mindfulness therapies like meditation.\\n\\nAs you can see, you zoom out when you look at TAM. For example, the revenue potential for a meditation mobile app, if it captures the whole TAM, would be 7.25 billion U.S. dollars by 2033, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1390630/meditation-app-market-forecast/). Because that’s how big the market for meditation apps is projected to get.\\n\\nOn a side note, when you want to perform TAM analysis, tapping resources like Statista and industry publications can help a lot. They offer the latest data and projections, which is enough at the TAM stage.\\n\\nBack to TAM… So, as you can see, you aren’t very concerned about any granular details when working with TAM. In general, TAM tells you three things:\\n\\n- **TAM tells you your app’s overall opportunity.** When planning a new app, you want to be sure there’s a market for it. TAM tells you just that. When performing TAM analysis, it’s important to remember that TAM doesn’t use any filters, so the market size it suggests isn’t your actual market. SAM helps define the actual market, as we’ll see in the next section.\\n- **TAM, by itself, is too broad.** Because TAM looks at the market theoretically, it’s crucial to consider SAM along with it, which provides a more realistic view of your app’s potential market .\\n- **TAM tells you how your target market could look if your app evolved into a more mature solution.** Adding PAM – Potentially Addressable Market – analysis on top of your TAM analysis can give ideas as to how your app could have a bigger target market than you initially estimated. For example, if, at some point, this meditation app from our example expanded to include online therapy, then this app could target even more users.\\n\\n## What is SAM?\\n\\nSAM – Serviceable Addressable Market or Serviceable Available Market – represents the market that you can actually target. To arrive at SAM, you apply filters to your TAM analysis and eliminate user populations that TAM included in your addressable market, but that don’t really belong to it.\\n\\nLet’s return to our meditation app example. Here are a few considerations we’d use for deducing the actual Service Addressable Market from its Total Addressable Market:\\n\\n- Suppose this app is to be available only in the U.S. This means the app’s TAM shrinks to represent the market available in the U.S. alone.\\n- Since this app only offers meditation, filtering at the feature level makes sense. For example, SAM would be the subset of the total U.S. population actively seeking or using a meditation app. So you might want to consider 12% of the total U.S. population to be your SAM, [as this population uses a mobile app to help with meditation.](https://www.statista.com/topics/11045/meditation-and-mental-wellness-apps/#editorsPicks) (Note: Again, resources like Statista help with SAM analysis.)\\n- Next, let’s say this is an iPhone app. This further excludes Android users from the growth calculations.\\n\\nYou get the drift.\\n\\nYour SAM is always a small percentage of your TAM. And in one way, your SAM is actually your TAM, because, in reality, it is the one that truly represents the available market. Also, while there’s no industry standard, some resources claim SAM to be generally about 1-10% of TAM.\\n\\n- **Depending on your app, you can have a small or big SAM, but a small SAM isn’t necessarily a problem.** A niche app will naturally have a much smaller SAM than apps targeting broader populations.\\n- **SAM helps you frame your monetization model.** If you have a niche app, you’re looking at a significantly small addressable user population or SAM. This means even if you reach a respectable user base, you’ll still not be looking at hundreds of thousands of users. If you use a strictly subscription-based monetization model for such an app, then you may limit your revenue potential. A hybrid monetization model could offer a better average revenue per user… and increase revenue.\\n- **SAM evolves as your app evolves.** As you start offering your app through additional channels (for example, adding your app to the Play Store, too, after initially only launching it in the App Store), regions, or languages, your SAM expands. Not just that, even if your app evolves into something bigger – for instance, if you start as a meditation app and eventually grow to become a full mindfulness app – you’ll see that your addressable market increases, too.\\n\\n## What is SOM?\\n\\nSOM – Serviceable Obtainable Market – represents the market that you can actually expect to target to convert. To calculate your SOM , you would need to consider factors such as market trends, the competitive landscape, and potential customer interest in your specific app. Unlike SAM, SOM considers your business’s realistic constraints and limitations, such as budget, resources, and capabilities. By understanding your SOM, you can set more achievable and accurate revenue goals for your mobile app.\\n\\nFor our meditation app example, estimating SOM would mean looking at the following factors:\\n\\n- **The app’s competitive landscape:** The most popular apps in any niche own most of the market share and revenue. So to start with, especially if you’re going after a competitive, money-making app niche, you need to understand the market share that you can realistically capture, given the shares that the most popular apps already own. If 95% of your app’s SAM already uses a leading meditation app for their meditation, you’re looking at a much smaller market. Factoring in the competition helps you calculate your SOM more realistically.\\n- **Your marketing bandwidth.** With SAM analysis, you’ll know exactly the market you can reach. But your marketing bandwidth plays a role in whether you can effectively reach the identified market share. If you have limited resources for marketing, your SOM may be smaller than initially anticipated.\\n- **Consumer behavior.** Your market’s buying behavior also influences you SOM. To estimate SOM, you must know what percent of your identified market will be willing to spend money on a mobile app (as that’s the share you’re after). Looking at the share of paying users across your niche can help estimate this. You’d need to understand your market’s general retention patterns as they tell how loyal your market can be. You might have to invest in research to find these out.\\n\\n**Macro trends would be another important consideration.** Macro trends can also impact your estimation of SOM, as shifts in the economy or industry can affect consumer spending habits. It’s important to consider these external factors when projecting your market share.\\n\\n## Market Sizing for a mobile app using TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses\\n\\nAdding TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses to your app marketing forces you to critically evaluate constraints like your funding and competition, allowing you to set realistic goals. These analyses also help position your app for sustainable growth by avoiding reliance on generalizations.\\n\\n[TAM, SAM, and SOM](https://blog.funnelfox.com/tam-sam-som-for-mobile-growth/) analyses continue to offer value even as your app evolves. As your app grows, you might see that your SOM is growing to include more of your SAM — for example, when more users learn about your app.\\n\\nNot just that, you might even decide to optimize your SAM by offering your app in more languages — by expanding to non-English speaking markets, for instance.\\n\\nYou may also discover that your TAM is larger than initially anticipated, leading to new opportunities for expansion.\\n\\nIn all, TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses can give a roadmap for strategic decision-making at all stages of an app’s growth funnel.\\n\\nLet’s now see how you can perform TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses for your app.\\n\\n## How to calculate your mobile app’s TAM, SAM, and SOM\\n\\n### Using the top-down approach\\n\\nIn the top-down approach to estimating TAM, SAM, and SOM, you start by including everyone who could potentially use your app in your TAM analysis.\\n\\nThen, you narrow it down to SAM by considering factors like demographics, geographic location, and purchasing power.\\n\\nFinally, you further refine it to SOM by factoring in your app’s unique value proposition and the competitive landscape.\\n\\nThe top-down approach for calculating TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses allows you to estimate your app’s market potential without relying on specific data, making it a handy tool for preliminary analysis. However, for the same reason, the top-down approach will almost always produce market sizing that may not reflect the real-world market because it relies heavily on broad assumptions and generalizations. So, validating these estimates with real data is important as you progress further into your business planning process.\\n\\n### Using the bottom-up approach\\n\\nIn the bottom-up approach to estimating TAM, SAM, and SOM, you start by calculating your SOM based on your existing user base.  If you use a [revenue management solution like Adapty for your app](https://adapty.io/), you probably already know who your paying users or subscribers are.\\n\\nIf your app is new or you don’t have enough sales data, define targeted segments that represent potential paying users using filters for demographics, behavior patterns, and geographic locations.\\n\\nNext, estimate your SAM by adding realistically accessible users, building from your known segments.\\n\\nFinally, expand to TAM by including all potential users.\\n\\nThis method provides a more accurate market estimate since it’s based on real data or targeted segments, unlike the top-down approach that relies on broad assumptions. This leads to a more precise and realistic market analysis.\\n\\n## Wrapping it up…\\n\\nConducting thorough TAM, SAM, and SOM analyses helps you realistically understand your app’s growth potential. For many niche apps, calculating TAM, SAM, and SOM might show that the app may only reach a few thousand subscribers, which isn’t a bad thing at all if the market is actually willing to commit to subscriptions.\\n\\nBut remember that these numbers can change over time as the market evolves and user preferences shift. It’s important to regularly reassess and update your market sizing analysis.\\n\\nAnd as we saw, the bottom-up approach tends to be more accurate. Since the bottom-up approach to estimating your TAM, SAM, and SOM needs your user spending behavior data, consider adding a [revenue analytics solution](https://adapty.io/revenue-analytics/) like Adapty to your app. This way, you’ll get a really accurate picture of your SOM and eventually your SAM and TAM.

Strategies](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/05/App-pricing_-Guide-to-pricing-tiers-and-strategies.png)\\n\\nIf your app is your business, your pricing model is your business model — plain and simple. By correctly understanding the needs of your customers and dividing them into segments with similar purchasing power, you can conquer the market in no time. You essentially create several products out of thin air — and all you need is just a good strategy.\\n\\nWe wrote this guide to help you do just that. We discuss the features and benefits of different pricing approaches, give you several examples and share our own experience and case studies. By the end of this guide, you should be fully versed in app pricing. Let’s go!\\n\\n## What is tiered pricing?\\n\\nTiered pricing is a strategy where you offer different levels of your product or service at varying prices. As an app developer, this means you can create several versions of your app, each with its own set of features and prices, to appeal to different types of users.\\n\\nHere’s how it works: you start with a basic version of your app that includes essential features at a lower price. Then, you create higher-priced versions that offer more advanced features or greater usage limits. For example, a basic plan might be $10 a month for limited access, while a premium plan could be $50 a month with all features and unlimited access. This way, users can choose the plan that best fits their needs and budget, and you can attract a wider audience.\\n\\nThe main benefit of tiered pricing is that it helps you reach different segments of the market. Beginners might start with the basic plan, while power users opt for premium features. This approach not only increases your revenue by encouraging users to upgrade, but it also provides flexibility, allowing customers to find the right balance between cost and value.\\n\\n![AD 4nXfu xxUo2dAoUDsrJub vVaWMhmCAGdjWGz5ZR5GOD3MxuqFV uwcd5ajwYceQ7n82GuafPrp8f4opbOTCkzk8J53z5KOGPfayvxkA JJo8J2BFazxE9lg4CdFKifxPMBMuD TP9zHvCE8k S0HP1PN7UD3?key=Xw zWyZKJ1WcD1 zBWtPg](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfu_xxUo2dAoUDsrJub_vVaWMhmCAGdjWGz5ZR5GOD3MxuqFV_uwcd5ajwYceQ7n82GuafPrp8f4opbOTCkzk8J53z5KOGPfayvxkA-JJo8J2BFazxE9lg4CdFKifxPMBMuD_TP9zHvCE8k_S0HP1PN7UD3?key=Xw_zWyZKJ1WcD1-_zBWtPg)\\n\\n## Benefits of using tiered pricing models\\n\\nImplementing tiered pricing models offers several key advantages for app developers.\\n\\nFirst, tiered pricing can **significantly increase revenue**. By offering multiple price points, businesses can attract a broader range of customers, from budget-conscious buyers to those willing to pay more for premium features. This approach not only brings in more customers but also encourages existing customers to upgrade to higher-priced tiers as they see the value in the additional features or services offered.\\n\\nSecond, tiered pricing **helps with customer segmentation**. By creating different tiers, businesses can cater to the specific needs and preferences of various customer groups. For instance, a basic tier might appeal to casual users or small businesses, while a premium tier attracts power users or larger organizations. This segmentation allows businesses to better understand their customers and tailor their marketing and development efforts accordingly.\\n\\nLastly, tiered pricing **enhances the perceived value of your product** or service. When customers see a range of options, they can compare features and benefits more easily, which helps them appreciate the value of higher-priced tiers. This comparison often makes the premium options seem more attractive and worthwhile, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.\\n\\n## How to calculate tiered pricing for your app?\\n\\n1. **Analyze Your Costs and Value Proposition.** Start by understanding the costs involved in running your app, including both fixed costs like development and server maintenance, and variable costs such as customer support and transaction fees. Additionally, clearly define the value your app provides to users.\\n2. **Segment Your Market.** Identify [different user segments](https://adapty.io/blog/user-segmentation-guide/) based on their needs and willingness to pay. Consider what features or services each segment values the most, such as essential features for basic users, additional features for standard users, and comprehensive features for premium users.\\n3. **Define Your Tiers.** Create different pricing tiers that cater to these segments. For example, you might have a Basic Plan with only essential features, a Standard Plan with more features and moderate usage, and a Premium Plan with all features and high usage limits.\\n4. **Set Pricing Based on Value and Costs.** Determine the pricing for each tier by considering the value provided to users and your costs. Make sure each tier is profitable by including both the fixed and variable costs, along with a desired profit margin.\\n5. **Test and Adjust.** Launch your pricing tiers and monitor user feedback and sales data. Be ready to adjust your pricing and tiers based on how users respond and how well each tier performs in the market.\\n6. **Communicate Value.** Ensure that users understand the value they get at each pricing tier. Use clear descriptions and comparisons to highlight the benefits of upgrading to higher tiers, making it easy for users to see why they should choose a more expensive option.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| With Adapty, you can write, design, and adapt paywalls with no hustle and extra code.

Each model offers unique features and pricing to match the needs of various customers. Here’s a simple overview of the common types of tiered pricing models:\\n\\n### Starter\\n\\nThe ‘Starter’ tier is usually designed for new or casual users who need basic features. This tier typically includes essential functionalities at no price, making it accessible to individuals or small businesses with limited budgets. The goal is to attract users with a no entry cost, encouraging them to try your app without a significant financial commitment. The Starter tier helps build your user base and provides an opportunity for upselling to higher tiers later.\\n\\n### Standard\\n\\nThe ‘Standard’ tier is aimed at regular users who need more features and higher usage limits. It strikes a balance between cost and value and is often the most popular choice. This tier usually includes additional features and better support, catering to small to medium-sized businesses or more serious individual users. The Standard tier is often seen as the best value for money, providing a comprehensive set of features without the premium price tag.\\n\\n### Premium\\n\\nThis tier targets users who need the full range of features and are willing to pay a higher price for them. This tier includes all the advanced functionalities, highest usage limits, and premium support options. Ideal for large businesses or power users, the Premium tier offers the best possible experience and the most value. Users at this level are looking for maximum performance and are less price-sensitive, focusing more on the benefits and exclusive features provided.\\n\\n![AD 4nXddZgWxK0cHSugvTlHP2urCLkVCGK0zkT9HpX3oB4BpPdeJm3IfdYRJEwP3ER6VdmkFOXBxFI1JzbwgQuhI yEG9Qt2IzS6u2SaODW3mr8w UYyyO24Af6P4E8E8KAEhJp64doMp7F1n3JV6GesDiXaEBBq?key=Xw zWyZKJ1WcD1 zBWtPg](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXddZgWxK0cHSugvTlHP2urCLkVCGK0zkT9HpX3oB4BpPdeJm3IfdYRJEwP3ER6VdmkFOXBxFI1JzbwgQuhI-yEG9Qt2IzS6u2SaODW3mr8w_UYyyO24Af6P4E8E8KAEhJp64doMp7F1n3JV6GesDiXaEBBq?key=Xw_zWyZKJ1WcD1-_zBWtPg)\\n\\n## **Example: How we use tiered pricing at Adapty**\\n\\n**Adapty** is a platform that allows app developers to supercharge their monetization strategy. We also [employ tiered pricing](https://adapty.io/pricing/) to effectively meet the diverse needs of our clients:\\n\\n1. **Free Plan** costs $0 per month and is ideal for businesses with up to $10K in monthly revenue. It includes basic features to help you get started without any initial investment.\\n2. **Pro Plan** charges 1% of your revenue with a minimum fee of $99 per month. It includes advanced features like A/B testing for paywalls, integrations, advanced analytics, and chat support, making it suitable for growing businesses.\\n3. **Pro+ Plan** costs 1.2% of your revenue with a minimum fee of $499 per month. It includes all Pro Plan features plus ETL integrations, LTV and revenue prediction, and priority chat support, designed for larger businesses needing comprehensive support and analytics.\\n\\nAs you can see, while we have a minimum monthly fee, the payment actually depends on the size of your app. This is fair for both developers and the company — the bigger you are, the more features you need, and the higher our costs are.\\n\\nJust look at our clients, who employed a similar approach to pricing and got great results:\\n\\nFor instance, [Moonly scaled from $0 to $2.45M](https://adapty.io/case-studies/moonly-app/) in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by utilizing Adapty’s infrastructure for in-app subscriptions and analytics. This allowed them to make data-driven decisions and continuously experiment with their paywalls, ultimately improving conversion rates and user retention.\\n\\nSimilarly, Union Apps used Adapty to grow the revenue of Prime Fasting from [$205k to $2.5M ARR in just six months](https://adapty.io/case-studies/union-apps/). By leveraging Adapty’s analytics and A/B testing capabilities, they optimized onboarding processes and paywall designs to significantly boost their app’s monetization.\\n\\nAvatarify, another app that adopted Adapty, [grew from $0 to over $200k in monthly recurring revenue (MRR)](https://adapty.io/case-studies/avatarify/). They benefited from Adapty’s accurate subscription data and [fallback paywalls](https://adapty.io/fallback-paywalls/), which ensured they captured revenue even when users faced connectivity issues.\\n\\n## Popular tiered pricing strategies\\n\\nHere are some strategies you can use as an inspiration for your app.\\n\\n### Three-tier pricing\\n\\nA three-tier pricing strategy offers products or services in three distinct levels: Basic, Standard, and Premium. This approach helps businesses cater to different customer needs and budgets, maximizing revenue and customer satisfaction.\\n\\n|     |     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | **Basic Tier** | **Standard Tier** | **Premium Tier** |\\n| Structure | Provides essential features at the lowest price. | Includes additional features and benefits at a moderate price. | Offers the full range of features and highest level of service at the highest price. |\\n| Benefits | Attracts cost-conscious customers and lowers the barrier to entry. | Balances cost and value, often becoming the most popular choice. | Targets customers who need comprehensive solutions and are willing to pay more for the best experience. |\\n\\nThis approach is easier understood with some examples:\\n\\n**Spotify’s** three-tier pricing strategy includes a free Basic tier that offers ad-supported listening with limited skips. The Standard tier, known as Premium, provides ad-free music, offline downloads, and enhanced sound quality. Their Premium Family tier caters to households, offering multiple accounts at a discounted rate, which encourages family members to switch from individual plans to a shared one.\\n\\n**Dropbox** offers a Basic tier with free storage to attract new users. Their Standard tier, called Plus, provides additional storage and basic sharing features at a moderate price. The Premium tier, known as Professional, offers advanced sharing options, extensive storage, and priority support, targeting professionals and businesses that require more robust features.\\n\\n**Adobe’s** three-tier pricing includes a Single App plan, allowing users access to just one Adobe application, ideal for those with specific needs. The Standard All Apps plan gives access to the entire suite of Adobe applications, catering to users who require multiple tools. For businesses, Adobe offers Premium plans with enhanced collaboration features, additional storage, and advanced support, ensuring comprehensive solutions [for large teams and enterprises](https://adapty.io/for-enterprises/).\\n\\n### Multiple-tier pricing\\n\\nA multiple-tier pricing strategy involves offering several pricing levels, each with different features and benefits. This approach gives customers more options, allowing them to choose a plan that best fits their needs and budget. By providing a wider range of choices, you can attract a broader audience and better meet diverse customer requirements.\\n\\nThe main advantage of multiple-tier pricing is its flexibility. It allows you to segment your market more precisely and cater to different user groups, from basic users to those needing advanced features. This strategy can lead to increased customer satisfaction because users can select the plan that offers the best value for them. It also encourages users to upgrade as their needs grow, providing a clear path for scaling usage and spending.\\n\\nOf course, this comes with some challenges. Managing and maintaining several pricing tiers can be complex, requiring careful planning and constant monitoring to ensure each tier remains attractive and competitive. It may also lead to customer confusion if the differences between tiers are not clearly communicated.\\n\\n### Feature-based tiers\\n\\nIn feature-based tiering, each tier provides a different set of features, and customers choose their tier based on the functionalities they need. This method allows you to segment your market effectively, offering various levels of service to meet different user requirements.\\n\\n**Canva** offers three tiers: Free, Pro, and Enterprise. The Free tier includes basic design tools and templates, while the Pro tier adds advanced features like brand kits, unlimited folders, and access to premium templates. The Enterprise tier includes everything in Pro plus additional team collaboration tools and dedicated support, catering to large organizations.\\n\\n**Slack**‘s pricing tiers are Free, Standard, Plus, and Enterprise Grid. The Free tier offers limited message history and integrations. The Standard tier adds features like unlimited message history and group calls. The Plus tier includes advanced administration and support features, while the Enterprise Grid provides extensive security and compliance features for large enterprises.\\n\\nFeature-based tiering  allows you to cater to a wide range of customers, from those who need only basic functionalities to those requiring advanced features. This approach can increase customer satisfaction, as users can find a plan that fits their specific needs. It also provides clear upgrade paths, encouraging users to move to higher tiers, which in turn leads to increased revenue as customers opt for more expensive plans.\\n\\n### Usage-based tiers\\n\\nWith this strategy, customers are charged based on the level of usage or consumption of a product or service. This approach is particularly effective for businesses where usage can vary significantly among customers, ensuring that users only pay for what they actually use.\\n\\nOne of the primary benefits of usage-based tiering is its fairness and flexibility. Customers appreciate paying only for what they consume, which can attract a larger user base and increase customer satisfaction. This model leads to higher and transparent revenue potential, as customers who heavily use the service will pay more.\\n\\nUsage-based tiering is ideal for services where consumption can be easily measured and tracked. Cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure use this model, charging customers based on their usage of computing resources, storage, and data transfer. Utility companies also employ this strategy, billing customers based on their actual consumption of electricity, water, or gas.\\n\\nThe usage-based approach offers a flexible and fair pricing model that aligns costs with actual usage. It benefits both businesses and customers by ensuring efficient use of resources and providing clear value for money. This strategy is particularly suitable for industries where consumption varies widely and can be accurately measured.\\n\\n![AD 4nXfsWflBTGYcSdT4u8j0c3aS qqJnxkpzTIxYNlwz M0KBzPp8 wJhuTEpCUVAQ4le0UwaomAkH2 GjE 8 Eonid9oduwdxVRXshKd2Agxv3V7e35OZqvzh r1 TiaGRZTz7QlYurNmdGiRmpHfUYgqkal8w?key=Xw zWyZKJ1WcD1 zBWtPg](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfsWflBTGYcSdT4u8j0c3aS_qqJnxkpzTIxYNlwz_M0KBzPp8_wJhuTEpCUVAQ4le0UwaomAkH2_GjE-8-Eonid9oduwdxVRXshKd2Agxv3V7e35OZqvzh-r1-TiaGRZTz7QlYurNmdGiRmpHfUYgqkal8w?key=Xw_zWyZKJ1WcD1-_zBWtPg)\\n\\n## Challenges of using tiered pricing\\n\\nTiered pricing models can present several challenges. One common issue is customer confusion, as users might find it difficult to understand the differences between tiers and the value each one offers. This confusion can lead to frustration and potential loss of sales. To overcome this, you should provide clear, concise information and comparisons between tiers.\\n\\nAnother issue is maintaining the right balance between tiers. If the pricing or features of one tier are too similar to another, it can cannibalize sales, causing your customers to choose lower-priced options that offer nearly the same value. Ensure that each tier is distinct and offers a unique set of features that justify its price point.\\n\\nManaging and updating multiple tiers can be complex and resource-intensive. Frequently review and adjust the tiers based on customer feedback to keep the model effective. Using customer data and analytics can help businesses make informed decisions about when and how to update their pricing tiers to stay competitive and meet evolving customer needs.\\n\\n## Tiered pricing vs other pricing models\\n\\nTiered pricing model allows businesses to attract a wide range of customers and encourage upgrades by providing various features at different price points. While effective, tiered pricing can be complex to manage and may confuse customers if the differences between tiers are not clearly communicated.\\n\\nFlat-rate pricing charges a single price for a product or service, regardless of usage. Its simplicity makes it appealing and easy for customers to understand, often leading to straightforward decision-making. However, it may not capture the full revenue potential from heavy users, who could be willing to pay more for additional usage, and might not provide enough value differentiation for lighter users, potentially leaving some feeling overcharged.\\n\\nFreemium pricing offers a basic version of a product or service for free, with paid tiers providing advanced features. This model can attract a large user base quickly, as it allows potential customers to try the product before committing financially. The challenge lies in [converting free users to paying customers](https://adapty.io/blog/trial-conversion-rates-for-in-app-subscriptions/), as many might be satisfied with the free version.\\n\\nPer-user pricing charges based on the number of users and makes it scalable with the growth of the customer’s business. This model is straightforward and aligns costs with the number of users, which can be attractive to larger organizations. However, it might deter smaller teams or businesses due to higher costs per user, especially if they do not see the immediate value or if their usage does not justify the expense.\\n\\n## Tips to create an effective tiered pricing plan\\n\\nBegin by conducting **comprehensive market research** to understand your industry landscape and competitor pricing strategies. Identify the pricing models of successful competitors and analyze what features they offer at each price point. This will help you determine a baseline for your tiers. Use surveys, focus groups, and customer interviews to gather insights into what features your target market values most and what they are willing to pay for these features.\\n\\n**Customer feedback is crucial** in shaping a tiered pricing plan that meets the needs of your user base. Collect feedback continuously through various channels, such as direct surveys, customer support interactions, and social media. Pay close attention to common pain points and feature requests. Use this feedback to adjust your tiers, ensuring that each level offers valuable features that resonate with your customers.\\n\\nEnsure that each pricing tier is clearly defined and **offers distinct value propositions**. The differences between tiers should be easy to understand and compelling enough to justify the price differences. Use clear and straightforward language to describe the benefits of each tier. Visual aids like comparison tables can be highly effective in highlighting the differences and helping customers make informed decisions.\\n\\nOnce you have implemented the pricing strategy, **optimize it continuously**. Regularly analyze sales data, customer behavior, and market trends to identify areas for improvement. Conduct A/B testing with different pricing levels and feature combinations to determine what works best. Be prepared to iterate and refine your tiers based on this data. Monitoring [key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-measure-app-performance/) such as conversion rates, churn rates, and [customer lifetime value](https://adapty.io/blog/customer-lifetime-value-ltv/) can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your pricing strategy.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

Growth stalls. Acquisition channels saturate. The tactics that worked early no longer work.\\n\\nGetting to $100K MRR requires a fundamental shift from hustle to systems, from guessing to measuring, from scattered efforts to coordinated execution.\\n\\nWe’ve put together seven key questions (and answers to them) that help acquire the systematic way of thinking that unlocks continuous growth. Let’s break them down.\\n\\n## **How to set up app analytics right?**\\n\\nUser acquisition metrics live in ad platforms. Revenue sits in spreadsheets. Product behavior exists in separate analytics tools. The problem is that these three areas constantly influence each other.\\n\\nConnect three core layers:\\n\\n- **UA analytics (CPI, CTR, CPM)** show how marketing spend converts into users\\n- **Monetization analytics (MRR, CAC, LTV)** reveal how those users generate revenue and how effective UA is compared to your earnings\\n- **Product analytics (retention, funnel conversion, feature adoption)** track behavior that drives retention and conversion\\n\\nStart simple. Pull data from ad managers and app store consoles manually. As you grow, add a Mobile Measurement Partner solution to track traffic attribution. By $100K MRR, centralize everything in a BI system where all three layers connect in real time.\\n\\nBetter retention increases LTV, giving you room to bid higher on acquisition. Higher-quality traffic converts better. A strong product creates organic growth. These connections only become visible when you track everything together.\\n\\n![Screenshot 2025 10 17 At 12.04.35](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-17-at-12.04.35-1024x635.png)\\n\\nThere is no one-fits-all solution for every team, but having a unified view is what matters most.\\n\\n## **When and how to start paid ads for a mobile app?**\\n\\nMost apps hit organic growth ceilings around $10K MRR. That’s when paid acquisition becomes necessary. But jumping in unprepared burns cash quickly.\\n\\nFirst, you need to determine how suited your app is for paid channels.\\n\\n- Thanks to higher LTV and retention, **health & fitness** apps, **productivity** tools, and **education** apps, among others, typically work well.\\n- Utility apps (scanners, cleaners, file managers), niche content, and one-time purchases may struggle.\\n\\nThe deciding factor is LTV. Calculate your 12-month lifetime value and divide by two. That’s your maximum sustainable acquisition cost (CAC). If the math doesn’t yet work, focus on improving retention and revenue per user before spending on ads.\\n\\n💡 Newer apps may not have enough data to calculate LTV reliably. Use our [LTV Prediction Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j8lZFpnwal8LEnvEY4Iir285UvyFLzgGsQr_MDvILgk/edit?gid=1623908029#gid=1623908029) to get approximate numbers.\\n\\nWhen you’re confident in your ability to acquire users in paid channels with profit, start with one channel. **Meta Ads** is where most apps begin because it offers massive reach and a straightforward setup.\\n\\nNext, you need to budget right. Running below $50 daily slows algorithm learning. Start at $100 to $200 daily with at least 15 creative variations — the more, the better. Monitor for 3 to 5 days, then shift budget to top performers.\\n\\nStart scaling budgets when unit economics prove positive. And remember to refresh creatives every 2 to 3 weeks to avoid ad fatigue and keep UA metrics reasonable.\\n\\n## **How to produce low-cost and effective ad creatives?**\\n\\nMost creatives fail. And even successful ads lose relevance within 2 to 4 weeks. When audiences tire of seeing the same ad, engagement drops, platforms reduce delivery, and your return on ad spend falls.\\n\\nFresh content resets the cycle. That’s why you’ll need a constant stream of new creatives.\\n\\nFor first experiments with paid channels, start with static ones. Images and carousels are fast and cheap to test. When a static version shows promise, upgrade to video. UGC videos work particularly well on TikTok because they feel native.\\n\\nYour rotation schedule depends on spending level:\\n\\n- **High spend ($500+ daily)**: introduce new creatives every 7–10 days\\n- **Lower spend ($100–$200 daily)**: refresh every 2–3 weeks\\n\\nWatch your click-through rate. A 20 to 40 percent drop signals it’s time to refresh.\\n\\nStudy competitors for inspiration. Use Meta Ad Library to find active ads. Check TikTok’s Top Ads page for your category. Borrow what works and test variations.\\n\\nAI is a good way to test new formats and hypotheses at a low cost, especially at early stages. Use it to generate ideas, visuals, voiceovers, and short videos for quick validation. Once a concept proves effective, rebuild it with real people or higher-quality footage to maximize performance.\\n\\nAs you grow, your production needs scale. We are breaking down different levels of setup this way:\\n\\n| Level | MRR Range | Setup | Description | Cost Focus |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **1\\\\. Going solo** | <$15K | DIY | Use AI for ideas, static images, and simple videos. Shoot basic UGC yourself. Great for early testing. | Time |\\n| **2\\\\. Freelancers** | <$50K | In-house strategy + outsourced production | Hire creators from marketplaces ($150–300/video) or freelancers (~$50/video). Quality varies, so write clear briefs. | Per-video fees |\\n| **3\\\\. Agency** | <$100K | Outsourced production | Let a creative shop handle volume. You focus on testing and UA. Faster delivery, less control. | A few thousand $/month |\\n| **4\\\\. In-house team** | <$500K | Internal production | Build your own team for speed, feedback, and brand control. Higher cost but better performance. | Salaries + tools |\\n| **5\\\\. In-house + agencies** | >$500K | Hybrid | Combine internal team with multiple agencies for variety and scale. High resource demand but maximum output. | Mixed (high) |\\n\\n## **How do tests help grow an app’s revenue?**\\n\\nMost subscriptions happen during or immediately after onboarding. This is your strongest lever for converting new users into paying customers.\\n\\nBoth the onboarding flow and the paywall help convince a user to convert. Even the smallest details may impact their decision. Here’s what to test on paywalls to find the best combination of elements:\\n\\n- Price points and plan mix across weekly, monthly, and annual.\\n- Trial presence and length; messaging around cancellation.\\n- Layout and defaults: clear comparison, best‑value highlight, confident CTA.\\n- Timing: end of onboarding, after a meaningful action, and later sessions.\\n\\nFind a full list of paywall test ideas [here](https://adapty.notion.site/paywall-testing-checklist).\\n\\nOnboarding elements matter equally. Number of screens, personalization, visual design, copy, signup friction, and social proof all impact whether users convert. Here are the key levers:\\n\\n- Sequence length that matches complexity and reduces uncertainty.\\n- Light personalization via goals or a short quiz.\\n- Friction management: login via socials or “try first” paths where possible.\\n- Micro‑moments: progress, small wins, and supportive visuals.\\n\\nSet metrics before testing. Your primary targets are LTV and ARPU. Since these take months to reflect changes, use proxy metrics that predict long-term impact: trial conversion rates, onboarding completion, Day 1 retention, and user engagement ratios.\\n\\nRun single-variable A/B tests: if you test several elements at once, you won’t know what caused the change.\\n\\n## **When should you expand into new paid channels for your app?**\\n\\nTo accelerate growth, apps eventually start new ad channels. Remember: do it **only** if your current channel is profitable and stable.\\n\\nAdding channels won’t fix slowing growth. If your MRR is flat, CPIs are rising, and click-through rates are dropping, the issue lies in your funnel or creatives, not missing platforms.\\n\\nYour signal to expand isn’t reaching a revenue milestone. It’s when your unit economics become predictable: consistent positive return on ad spend, customer acquisition cost lower than lifetime value, and retention holding steady.\\n\\nWe’ve already covered Meta, so here are the **essentials about other channels:**\\n\\n- **[TikTok](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-use-tiktok-ads-for-subscription-apps/):** UGC‑first scripts and quick storytelling; video-heavy.\\n- **[Apple Search Ads](https://adapty.io/blog/apple-ads-best-practices/):** high‑intent traffic; optimize store assets and CPP usage.\\n- **[Google App Campaigns](https://adapty.io/blog/google-app-campaigns-playbook-2025/):** broad reach; feed strong conversion signals.\\n\\nNew channels serve to reduce platform dependency, diversify reach, and smooth seasonality. Each platform has different audience sizes, creative rules, and performance characteristics. So, master one before adding another.\\n\\n## **How and when to launch an app in new markets?**\\n\\nAnother leap of growth is to expand to new markets. Most apps start in Tier 1 English markets where iOS spend is high, but growth eventually stabilizes.\\n\\nOnly expand when your current market generates predictable unit economics. Test one new market at a time with a small budget.\\n\\n- Run a soft launch with $2K to $5K over 2 to 4 weeks using channels that already perform.\\n- Localize only what drives revenue: your app store page, onboarding copy, and paywall pricing.\\n- Skip translating everything else initially.\\n\\nWhen choosing your next market, start by spotting early signals. For example, regions where your app gains downloads even without localization. Then, evaluate the market’s potential based on economic factors. Here’s the average 12-month LTV by country, per [Adapty data](https://adapty.io/state-of-in-app-subscriptions/):\\n\\n![Screenshot 2025 10 17 At 15.06.33](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-17-at-15.06.33-1024x1009.png)\\n\\nAfter the test, evaluate three metrics: LTV compared to customer acquisition cost (aim for at least 2x), trial to paid conversion (within 10 percent of your core market), and Day 30 retention (in line with your best markets). If two out of three look solid, continue. Otherwise, pause and diagnose.\\n\\n## **Where to get funding to fuel app growth**?\\n\\nWhether you need external funding depends on your ambitions and competitive landscape.\\n\\nFirst thing to know is that ad platforms offer deferred payments, meaning you have 30 days to pay the invoice for ads. This delay can be helpful for fast-growing apps, but it’s not the same as real financing.\\n\\nFor easier navigation, we put all viable options in this table:\\n\\n|     |     |     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | **Deferred payments (Ad platforms)** | **Factoring** | **Revenue-** **based financing** | **VC / Angel investment** |\\n| Pros | Smooths cash flow | Immediate cash, non-dilutive | More capital, flexible payback | Large funds + support |\\n| Cons | Not real funding (no extra cash) | Advance < payout | Costlier than factoring | Dilution, high expectations |\\n| Cost | No fee (if on time) | Low single-digit fees | ~1.1×–1.5× repay cap | 15–25% equity |\\n| Speed | Days-weeks setup | Days after setup | Days after setup | Angels: weeks; VCs: months |\\n| Best for | Fast-scaling UA spenders | $20K–50K MRR apps | $50K+ MRR with steady growth | Exceptional apps needing rapid scale |\\n\\n💡 For most apps, VC funding isn’t realistic. Angel investors are more flexible with smaller apps.\\n\\nChoose funding that matches your growth stage without compromising control unnecessarily.\\n\\n## Your growth checklist\\n\\nThe strategy comes down to these simple rules:\\n\\n— **Use analytics as your compass**. Eliminate blind spots and build a reliable setup, even if it starts simple.\\n\\n— **Start small with paid campaigns**. Focus on one channel first. Test with a reasonable budget, find the winning creatives, and scale them.\\n\\n— **Prioritize creative volume**. More creatives mean more chances to find what works. Learn from competitors and leverage AI to speed up production.\\n\\n— **Test systematically**. Begin with paywall elements and placements, then experiment with onboarding flows. Change one element at a time to track results accurately.\\n\\n— **Master one channel before adding another**. Don’t expand to fix performance issues.\\n\\n— **Validate new markets organically**. Look for early signals before investing in paid growth.\\n\\n— **Plan your financing thoughtfully**. Explore options like factoring, revenue-based financing, or investors based on your ambitions and current performance.\\n\\nFor a deeper look into how to reach $100K MRR for your app, download our full ebook.\\n\\n[Download now](https://adapty.io/ebooks/100k-app-playbook/)\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### When should I start running paid ads for my mobile app?\\n\\nMost apps hit an organic growth ceiling around $10K MRR. That’s when paid acquisition starts making sense. Begin small with one channel like Meta Ads, test multiple creatives, and scale once you see positive unit economics.\\n\\n### How often should I refresh my ad creatives?\\n\\nMonitor your click-through rate. If it drops 20 to 40 percent, refresh immediately. For high-spend accounts ($500+ daily), introduce new creatives every 7 to 10 days. For lower spends, refresh every 2 to 3 weeks.\\n\\n### Should I test multiple ad channels simultaneously to find the best one?\\n\\nNo. Spreading the budget thinly across channels prevents any single platform from accumulating enough data to optimize effectively. Master one channel completely before adding another.\\n\\n### When should I expand to new markets?\\n\\nOnly when your unit economics are predictable in your current market. Test new markets one at a time with a $2K to $5K soft launch budget. Ensure your core metrics hold before scaling.\\n\\n### Is it better to bootstrap or raise funding?\\n\\nIt depends on your category and competitive pressure. If your app generates positive unit economics and you’re comfortable with slower growth, bootstrap. If you’re competing in a winner-takes-all market where speed matters, external funding becomes necessary.\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.

1](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/06/fee-system-in-app-purchase-preview-1.webp)\\n\\n**TL;DR: Apple replaced its simple €0.50 fee with a multi-layered external payment system including 2% acquisition fees, 5-13% store service fees, and a 5% Core Technology Commission – all to avoid additional EU penalties.**\\n\\nApple just beat the deadline. With hours to spare before facing new EU penalties, the tech giant [announced](https://developer.apple.com/news/) sweeping changes to its European App Store in-app purchase fee structure on June 26. But instead of simplifying, Apple introduced what might be the most complicated commission system in App Store history.\\n\\nThe changes were designed to satisfy European regulators who [fined Apple €500 million in April](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/eu-fines-apple-meta-millions-for-breaching-tech-competition-rules/) for violating the Digital Markets Act. Apple’s response was to technically comply while creating a system so complex it might discourage developers from using external payments.\\n\\nIs this genuine compliance or strategic resistance? Let’s unpack Apple’s latest moves and see whether they solve the regulatory standoff or just create more confusion.\\n\\n## The new EU App Store fee structure breakdown\\n\\nApple’s new EU **external payment** fee structure replaces one simple charge with multiple overlapping fees for developers who want to use non-Apple payment systems.\\n\\n### Initial acquisition fee: 2%\\n\\nFor the first six months after a user downloads your app, [Apple takes 2%](https://developer.apple.com/support/communication-and-promotion-of-offers-on-the-app-store-in-the-eu/#alt-terms-eu) of any digital sales made through external payment systems. This applies to new users only, existing customers don’t trigger this fee.\\n\\n![Apple's EU in-app purchase fee structure showing two tiers: Tier 1 with 5% store services fee and Tier 2 with 13% fee, plus 2% acquisition fees and €0.50 Core Technology Fee](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/06/store-services-1024x841.webp)_Alternative terms addendum for apps in the EU_\\n\\n### Core Technology Commission (CTC): 5%\\n\\nThis new 5% fee replaces the old flat €0.50 charge per install. It applies to apps using Apple’s development tools and platform, regardless of where purchases happen. The fee is charged within 12 months of the most recent install, update, or reinstall.\\n\\n### Store services fee:\\n\\nApple split its app store services into [two packages](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/store-services-tiers):\\n\\n- **Tier 1 (5% fee)**: Basic package including app reviews, manual updates, and fraud protection. This tier is mandatory for any app that promotes external payment options.\\n- **Tier 2 (13% fee)**: Full package adding marketing tools, automatic updates, app recommendations, analytics dashboards, and promotional features.\\n\\nSmall business program members get a discount, paying 10% instead of 13% for Tier 2 services.\\n\\n![Apple EU Store Services comparison showing Tier 1 vs Tier 2 in-app purchase fee features: both tiers include trust & safety features, but only Tier 2 offers expedited app reviews](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2025/06/store-services-tiers-1024x704.webp)[_Store Services tiers_](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/store-services-tiers)\\n\\n### The transition timeline\\n\\nDevelopers currently paying the €0.50 Core Technology Fee have until January 1, 2026 to switch to the new percentage-based system. After that date, everyone moves to the CTC structure.\\n\\nUnder the new system, a developer using external payments could pay up to 20% in combined fees (2% + 13% + 5%) compared to Apple’s standard 30% App Store commission. However, the math gets complicated depending on timing, user type, and service tier choices.\\n\\n## Cost analysis: should you switch?\\n\\nThe new fee structure creates winners and losers depending on your app’s business model and user base. Let’s figure out which category you fall into:\\n\\n### Scenario 1: High-volume apps with established users\\n\\nApps with mostly existing users benefit the most from external payments:\\n\\n- No 2% acquisition fee on existing customers\\n- Can choose Tier 1 services (5%) to minimize costs\\n- Total external payment fees: 10% (5% + 5% CTC)\\n\\n**You save 20%. Pay 10% instead of 30% App Store commission**\\n\\n### Scenario 2: Growing apps with new user acquisition\\n\\nApps actively acquiring new users face higher costs:\\n\\n- 2% acquisition fee applies for first 6 months on new users\\n- Need Tier 2 services (13%) for growth features\\n- Total fees: 20% (2% + 13% + 5% CTC)\\n\\n**You save 10%. Pay 20% instead of 30% App Store commission**\\n\\n### Scenario 3: Small Business Program members\\n\\nDevelopers already in Apple’s Small Business Program (under $1M annual revenue) currently pay 15% App Store commission:\\n\\n- Reduced Tier 2 fee: 10% instead of 13%\\n- Total maximum fees: 15% (10% + 5% CTC)\\n\\n**The same 15%.**\\n\\n### Platform comparison\\n\\nApple offers better terms on other platforms. macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS only charge a 3% fee for external payments, making iOS the most expensive platform for alternative payments.\\n\\n### When do external payments make sense?\\n\\nExternal payments are worth considering only if you meet all three criteria:\\n\\n1. Most of your revenue comes from existing users (so you avoid the 2% acquisition fee).\\n2. You can work with basic App Store services instead of premium features.\\n3. Your team can handle the technical complexity of managing your own payment system.\\n\\n### Hidden costs to consider\\n\\nApple’s fees are just the beginning. You’ll also pay payment processor fees (typically 2-3%), need fraud prevention systems, handle customer support for payment issues, and maintain payment infrastructure. These hidden costs can add another 3-5% to your total expenses.\\n\\nSo while Apple’s new fees range from 10-20%, your actual cost for external payments could be 13-25% when you include everything.\\n\\n### The bottom line: Should you switch?\\n\\nFor most developers, the answer is _not yet_.\\n\\n|     |     |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Switch if you’re:**<br>→ A high-volume app with mostly existing users<br>→ Already handling payment processing infrastructure<br>→ Comfortable with 10-15% total costs vs. 30% App Store fees | **Don’t switch if you’re:**<br>→ A growing app that needs new user acquisition<br>→ Relying on App Store marketing and discovery features<br>→ A small team without payment processing expertise |\\n\\nApple’s complex fee structure successfully discourages most developers from leaving. The 10-20 percentage point savings sound good until you factor in the operational complexity, hidden costs, and reduced App Store benefits.\\n\\nExternal payments work best for large, established apps that can absorb the complexity and already have strong direct relationships with their users.\\n\\n## Technical implementation details\\n\\nApple created two distinct pathways for developers who want to use external payments, each with different rules and requirements.\\n\\n### Option 1: Alternative Terms Addendum\\n\\nThis is for apps that mention external deals but don’t include direct payment links. Think of it as the “information only” option.\\n\\n- Apps can tell users about promotions, discounts, or subscription offers available elsewhere\\n- No clickable links or direct payment processing within the app\\n- Developers still pay the Core Technology Commission but avoid some additional fees\\n\\n→ [Check the official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/alternate_eu_terms_addendum.pdf)\\n\\n### Option 2: StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement\\n\\nThis is the full external payment option with actionable links that users can click.\\n\\n- Apps can include multiple external payment links with tracking parameters\\n- Links can redirect users to websites, alternative app stores, or other apps\\n- Developers can design custom promotional campaigns within their apps\\n- Full fee structure applies (acquisition fee + store services fee + CTC)\\n\\n→ [Check the official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/external-purchase)\\n\\n### Reporting and compliance requirements\\n\\nDevelopers using external payments must integrate [Apple’s External Purchase Server API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/externalpurchaseserverapi) to report transactions. This allows Apple to calculate and collect its commissions on purchases made outside the App Store.\\n\\nThe system tracks user acquisition sources, purchase timing, and service tier usage to determine which fees apply to each transaction.\\n\\n## Is this really compliance or just theater?\\n\\nThe response to Apple’s changes has been swift and largely critical, with industry leaders questioning whether Apple is genuinely complying with EU regulations.\\n\\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney immediately [criticized the changes on X](https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1938316411647988210). He called Apple’s approach “blatantly unlawful in both Europe and the United States” and accused Apple of making “a mockery of fair competition in digital markets.”\\n\\nSweeney argued that “Apps with competing payments are not only taxed but commercially crippled in the App Store,” pointing to the complexity as evidence that Apple is deliberately discouraging external payments.\\n\\n### Developer community concerns\\n\\nEarly developer reactions focus on three main issues:\\n\\n1. Small development teams worry about managing multiple fee calculations and compliance requirements.\\n2. Many developers question whether the potential 10-20% savings justify the operational overhead.\\n3. Concerns that Apple’s approach may not satisfy EU regulators, creating future uncertainty.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1938323753391317502\\n\\nWhile EU officials haven’t formally responded to Apple’s latest changes, the timing suggests regulatory pressure was effective. Apple announced these changes just hours before the June 26 deadline, indicating the company took the threat of additional penalties seriously.\\n\\nHowever, the complexity of the new system may invite further scrutiny. EU regulators previously criticized Apple for creating barriers that discourage competition, and this multi-layered fee structure could be seen as another form of that behavior.\\n\\n## What led to this showdown?\\n\\nThis latest fee restructuring is the culmination of a year-long regulatory battle between Apple and European authorities over digital market competition.\\n\\n### The Digital Markets Act\\n\\n[The EU’s Digital Markets Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en), which took effect in 2024, targets “gatekeeper” platforms like Apple’s App Store. The law requires these platforms to allow fair competition and prevent companies from favoring their own services over competitors.\\n\\n### Apple’s initial resistance\\n\\nApple’s first response to the DMA was minimal compliance. The company [allowed external payment links](https://adapty.io/blog/alternative-payments-in-the-app-store/) but charged a 27% commission on purchases made outside the App Store – barely different from the standard 30% App Store fee.\\n\\nApple also introduced [warning screens](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/08/apple-revises-dma-compliance-for-app-store-link-outs-applying-fewer-restrictions-and-a-new-fee-structure/) that appeared when users clicked external links, with language designed to discourage users from leaving Apple’s payment system. These screens warned about security risks and loss of Apple’s customer protection.\\n\\n### The €500M penalty\\n\\nIn April 2025, EU regulators lost patience with Apple’s approach. [The European Commission fined Apple €500 million](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085) for failing to comply with DMA requirements, specifically citing Apple’s anti-steering provisions that prevented developers from freely promoting alternative payment options.\\n\\nThe fine amount was calculated based on the “gravity and duration” of Apple’s non-compliance, with regulators arguing that Apple’s fee structure and warning screens effectively nullified the benefits the DMA was meant to provide.\\n\\n### The June 26 deadline\\n\\nFollowing the fine, Apple was given 60 days to demonstrate meaningful compliance or face additional penalties. The June 26 deadline created urgency that forced Apple’s hand, leading to these last-minute comprehensive changes.\\n\\n### Apple’s broader legal strategy\\n\\nThese EU changes are part of Apple’s global regulatory challenges. The company is simultaneously fighting similar battles in the United States with Epic Games and facing regulatory pressure in other markets including South Korea, Japan, and Australia.\\n\\nKey global regulatory battles:\\n\\n- **United States**: [Apple found in contempt](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-judge-rules-apple-violated-order-reform-app-store-2025-04-30/) for violating Epic Games court order, [appeals rejected](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-loses-bid-pause-app-store-reform-order-epic-games-case-2025-06-04/) by federal appeals court\\n- **South Korea**: [New payment law](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-first-country-to-curb-google-apples-in-app-billing-policies.html) targeting Apple and Google, with [ongoing regulatory scrutiny](https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/)\\n- **Japan**: [Antitrust regulator increasing scrutiny](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/09/04/japan-antitrust-regulator-to-increase-scrutiny-of-apples-app-store) of App Store practices\\n\\nApple has consistently argued that its App Store policies protect user security and privacy, while critics contend that Apple uses these justifications to maintain lucrative monopolistic practices.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nThis complex restructuring benefits Apple more than anyone else. While developers can theoretically save 10-20 percentage points on fees, the operational complexity and hidden costs mean most will stick with Apple’s standard App Store terms. Apple successfully turned regulatory compliance into a competitive moat.\\n\\nLarge, established apps with existing user bases emerge as the only clear winners, potentially saving meaningful money if they can navigate the complexity. Everyone else faces a system designed to discourage switching.\\n\\nThe critical question is whether EU regulators will accept this elaborate compliance effort or demand further simplification. Apple’s strategy bets that technical compliance is sufficient, even if the practical barriers remain high.\\n\\nIf regulators push back, Apple may face additional fines and pressure for more fundamental changes. If they accept this approach, other tech giants will likely adopt similar strategies of complex compliance that technically meets requirements while preserving business advantages.\\n\\nThis case will influence digital market regulation globally. Apple’s ability to maintain revenue streams while appearing to comply with competition laws provides a playbook for other platforms facing regulatory pressure.\\n\\nFor developers, the message is clear: while external payment options now exist in the EU, Apple has ensured that using them requires significant business justification. The 30% App Store commission remains the path of least resistance for most developers.\\n\\nThe ultimate test will be whether this regulatory theater produces real competition or simply creates the illusion of choice while preserving the status quo.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Alternative payment options on the App Store in the European Union](https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-the-eu/)\\n- [Using alternative payment options on the App Store in the European Union](https://developer.apple.com/support/apps-using-alternative-payment-providers-in-the-eu/)\\n- [Update on apps distributed in the European Union](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/)\\n- [Apple’s DMA Compliance Report](https://www.apple.com/legal/dma/dma-ncs.pdf)\\n\\n![Unlock the growth path to $100K MRR.
